## Garissa MCA Arrested Over Ksh51.4 Million Fraudulent Payments

A Member of County Assembly (MCA) from Garissa, along with two former senior county officials, has been arrested in connection with alleged fraudulent payments amounting to Ksh51.4 million. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) confirmed the arrests as part of its intensified efforts to combat graft within devolved governments.

The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) apprehended Balambala Ward MCA Abdi Ibrahim Daar, former Director of Accounting Services Mohamud Dubow Korane, and former Senior Principal Economist Yussuf Bethe Ali on Sunday, February 22, 2026. The trio was scheduled to be arraigned at the Garissa Law Courts on Monday, February 23, 2026, for plea taking in a case that underscores persistent vulnerabilities within regional governmental procurement systems.

### Allegations of Ksh51.4 Million Fraudulent Payments

The EACC investigation alleges that the three individuals conspired to commit corruption by facilitating fraudulent transfers from the Garissa County Government to a private entity, Qorjarey Enterprise and General Supplies Limited. These payments, totalling Ksh51,495,253, were purportedly for goods and services, including emergency food items, office furniture, and water trucking, that were neither procured nor supplied to the county government between April and June 2022.

According to charge documents, former Director of Accounting Services Mohamud Dubow Korane is accused of approving payments ranging from Ksh4.8 million to Ksh14.5 million to the implicated enterprise for unprocured items. Similarly, Yussuf Bethe Ali, the former Senior Principal Economist, allegedly raised invoices within the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) to facilitate these improper payments. MCA Abdi Ibrahim Daar faces additional charges of forgery for allegedly creating and presenting false documents, including letters of acceptance for contracts, to deceive both the county government and financial institutions. The payments were processed despite a lack of budgetary allocation or an approved procurement plan for the alleged supplies during the 2021/2022 financial year, and the company was not among the prequalified suppliers.

### Intensified Crackdown on Corruption and Fraudulent Payments

The arrests in Garissa are part of a broader, aggressive national effort by the EACC to eradicate systemic embezzlement in devolved governments. This crackdown follows a recent trend where the commission has intensified its operations against government officials involved in corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Just last month, the EACC announced the arraignment of six suspects, including four Homa Bay County officials, over alleged procurement irregularities valued at Ksh348.9 million related to the construction of the Homa Bay County Assembly Block.

This concerted effort by the EACC highlights a firm stance against the misuse of public resources. However, the recurring nature of such scandals raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of existing oversight mechanisms and the integrity of public service. As political journalists, we have previously covered instances where integrity in public office has been questioned, such as the [DCI Accuses Linda Wananchi Politicians, Arming Followers Linked to Supporter’s Death](https://zandani.co.ke/article/dci-accuses-linda-wananchi-politicians-arming-followers-supporter-death) report, underscoring a continuous struggle with accountability across various political spectrums. The EACC has stated its intention to institute civil suits to recover the unlawful payments from the suspects, reiterating its commitment to safeguarding public resources and urging public officers to uphold integrity and accountability. The successful prosecution and asset recovery in such high-stakes cases are crucial, serving as a deterrent to other corrupt syndicates attempting to siphon public funds.
