## The Nairobi Cooperation Agreement: Deciphering its Constitutional Wisdom

The recently signed Nairobi cooperation agreement between the National Government and Nairobi City County has ignited a fervent public debate. At its core, this agreement aims to coordinate responsibilities and strengthen county functions in Kenya's capital, rather than transfer power.

### Beyond the Rhetoric: Why this Nairobi Cooperation Agreement is Not a Power Grab

The narrative that any collaboration between national and county governments constitutes a "takeover" has become a troubling pattern in our public discourse. Critics often invoke Article 187 of the Constitution as a political alarm, rather than engaging with its legal nuances. A careful examination reveals that the Nairobi cooperation agreement is not a transfer of power, but the discharge of a constitutional duty. Assertions to the contrary do not withstand rigorous legal scrutiny.

Article 187 of the Constitution permits the transfer of functions between levels of government under strict conditions, including legality, effectiveness, and the transfer of necessary resources. However, such a transfer implies one level relinquishing a function and another assuming it. The current agreement explicitly states that collaboration is "directed towards strengthening the performance of county functions," emphasizing structured support, not surrender. Clause 4.1 outlines joint identification, funding, implementation, and monitoring of projects, ensuring both parties remain actively engaged. This framework fundamentally differs from a unilateral transfer. Governor Johnson Sakaja has robustly defended the agreement, clarifying that it does not amount to a transfer of functions under Article 187, which would necessitate a formal deed and could lead to a separate entity akin to the defunct Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS).

### The Imperative of Interdependence: A Constitutional Wisdom

Nairobi occupies a unique constitutional and geopolitical position. It is not merely a county; it is the seat of the national government, a host to numerous diplomatic missions, and a global hub. For a city of such strategic importance, institutional silos between the national and county governments are simply unsustainable.

The statutory backbone of this agreement is firmly anchored in Section 6 of the Urban Areas and Cities Act (Cap 275), which specifically addresses governance and infrastructure management in the capital city. This section anticipates integrated planning between national and county governments for strategic infrastructure and essential services, making coordination not discretionary, but legislated. As Governor Sakaja rightly pointed out, Section 6 of the Urban Areas and Cities Act mandates cooperation, underscoring that such collaboration is long overdue.

Furthermore, Article 6(2) of the Constitution unequivocally states that the two levels of government "are distinct and inter-dependent and shall conduct their mutual relations based on consultation and cooperation". The use of "shall" renders this a mandatory command for cooperation, not an optional suggestion. This constitutional directive for mutual relations based on consultation and cooperation is further operationalized by Article 189(2), which authorizes the establishment of joint committees and joint authorities. The steering and implementation committees created under the Nairobi cooperation agreement are precisely such instruments of constitutional design, not deviations from it. The Intergovernmental Relations Act (Cap 265F) also establishes a clear framework for consultation and cooperation, explicitly providing mechanisms for formal coordination agreements and enabling the establishment of joint committees.

### Enhancing Capacity, Not Centralizing Authority: The Promise of the Nairobi Cooperation Agreement

The priority sectors identified in the agreement-waste management, county roads and street lighting, markets, housing, and water and sanitation-are not abstract policy categories. They represent the daily frustrations of Nairobi residents: uncollected garbage, dilapidated roads, poorly lit streets, congested markets, and unreliable water supply. Addressing these pervasive challenges demands substantial capital investment, technical expertise, and sustained financing, often exceeding the capacity of the county alone.

This cooperation agreement, far from weakening devolution, aims to enhance county capacity. It does not transfer power; it coordinates responsibility. It does not centralize authority; it integrates effort. Clause 7.3 safeguards devolution by requiring projects to be properly costed and processed within the respective budgets of both governments, ensuring county budgetary authority remains intact. The national government supplements; it does not supplant.

The agreement also mandates public participation consistent with constitutional principles and statutory requirements, emphasizing enforceable governance practice. Citizens must interrogate this document, attend public forums, and demand accountability. The framework exists; civic vigilance must activate it. As Kenya continues to embrace digital solutions for governance and service delivery, as seen in initiatives like NTSA rolling out 1,000 speed cameras for instant fines and digital road enforcement, the principle of coordinated, effective governance becomes even more critical for urban centers like Nairobi.

Nairobi's complexity, driven by rapid urbanisation, unemployment pressures, environmental strain, and aging infrastructure, demands constitutional maturity. Cooperation is not capitulation; it is, in fact, profound constitutional wisdom. The agreement is a pragmatic response to the realities of governing a dynamic capital city, reflecting an understanding that collective effort is paramount for progress.
