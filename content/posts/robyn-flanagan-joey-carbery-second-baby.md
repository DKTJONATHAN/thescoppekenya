## Robyn Flanagan and Joey Carbery Announce Second Pregnancy
Right, so the big news making the rounds isn't about scrums or try-lines for once, Mate. Ireland rugby international Joey Carbery and his lovely wife, Robyn Flanagan, have officially announced they're expecting their second child. The couple, who welcomed their first son, Beau, in June 2024, shared the joyous news on Instagram with a sweet snap of little Beau pointing at Robyn's bump, captioned simply, "Beaus gonna be a big brother."

### From Pitches to Parenthood: Their Whirlwind Romance
Honestly, it's been an absolute whirlwind for these two, hasn't it? Robyn, originally from Athy in County Kildare, has been by Joey's side for years, with them shacking up in August 2021. Then, Joey did the proper romantic thing, popping the question in New York later that year. They had their official "I do" moment at Dublin's City Hall in May 2023, followed by a rather glamorous second celebration in sunny Marbella that June, surrounded by fellow rugby stars like Tadhg Beirne and Peter O'Mahony (and their equally fabulous wives, of course). Talk about a destination wedding!

### Life Beyond the Tackle
It's a proper testament to how these sports personalities manage to build such solid foundations amidst the absolute madness of professional sport. While Joey’s career has taken him from Leinster to Munster and even a stint with Bordeaux (before a knee injury, poor bloke), Robyn, who studied marketing and whose mum co-owns a boutique, has largely kept things grounded. It just goes to show, doesn't it, that while we're all busy watching the top-tier glamour, there's also an incredible amount of work happening at every level. Speaking of which, it reminds me of the chatter we had about whether grassroots efforts are finally getting their due, especially when you see things like ["Get Out Get Active Shortlisted for Sport Industry Award: Is Grassroots Finally Getting Its Due, Mate?"](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/get-out-get-active-sport-industry-award-shortlist-pundit-view). It’s easy to focus on the big names, but the foundations are crucial, eh?

### A Growing Family, A New Chapter
With Beau about to become a big brother, the Carbery-Flanagan household is set to get even livelier. It's a lovely bit of news for the couple, especially with Joey reportedly heading back to Leinster after his time in Bordeaux was cut short by injury. What a way to start a new chapter, eh? More nappies, less tackling (for Joey, anyway, on the pitch!), but undoubtedly a whole lot of love. We'll be keeping an eye out for baby number two, naturally. Will it be another little rugby star in the making, or perhaps a future fashionista like mum? Only time will tell!
