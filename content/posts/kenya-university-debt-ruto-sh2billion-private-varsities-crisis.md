Walahi, the way Kenyans on X are reacting to this whole university debt saga, you'd think it's a new season of *Money Heist*, bana! Everyone's just laughing and asking, "Serikali inawesaje kuwa na madeni kubwa hivi?" Jo, it’s wild!

**The Scoop**
So, word on the street, President William Ruto dropped a pledge on Friday, February 20, ati the government will pay Sh2 billion to Kenya Methodist University (KeMU). You'd think that's a lot, but manze, that's just a tiny piece of the pie. KeMU alone is owed more than Sh5 billion, and the bigger picture? The State apparently owes a whopping Sh60 billion to 32 private universities in total! Can you even imagine? Hii ni pesa mingi vibaya sana.

**The Evidence**
The President made this promise when he hosted the Methodist Church leadership at State House. Apparently, this Sh2 billion is part of the government's capitation debt to KeMU. See, the problem started way back when the government decided to place government-sponsored students in private universities to expand access to higher education. Sounds good on paper, right? But the payments never quite kept up. The program ran until the 2022/2023 financial year, when new placements stopped, and the debt has just been growing ever since, from Sh45 billion to Sh60 billion as students finish their courses.

Kwanza, the numbers don't lie. In 2025, 270,715 students met the requirements for uni admission, an increase from about 246,000 in 2024. More students, more pressure. These private varsities, like Mount Kenya University (owed Sh11.6 billion), KCA University (Sh6.6 billion), and Kabarak University (Sh6.4 billion), are literally struggling because the government hasn't paid tuition fees for students it placed there. It's like sending someone to eat at a vibanda then refusing to pay the bill! Walai, the Kenya Association of Private Universities (KAPU) even said they might sue the State Department.

**The Verdict**
Now, everyone is wondering if this Sh2 billion pledge is just lip service or if actual money will hit the bank. It feels like these institutions are being played, you know? It kinda reminds you of those stories we hear about big promises and then radio silence, kama vile wale [Online Scam Kings Wamechapwa Kiboko Noma! Interpol Imewasaka Africa Nzima!](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/online-scam-kings-wamechapwa-kiboko-interpol-imewasaka-africa-nzima) where people thought they'd get rich quick, then boom! Silence. Private universities hapa Kenya wako rada, manze. They just want their money so they can keep things running. It's not fair to the students ama the institutions when the government isn't paying up for services rendered. We'll be watching to see if this Sh2 billion actually materializes and if the rest of that Sh60 billion debt will ever be cleared. Because kama kawaida, actions speak louder than words, bana!
