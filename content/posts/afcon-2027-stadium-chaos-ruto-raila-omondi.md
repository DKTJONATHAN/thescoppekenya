## Wueh! The Gown is Long but the Ground is Very Tiny!
Sasa basi, listen up because the tea today is piping hot and it tastes like dust and broken promises. We are in February 2026, and the AFCON 2027 "Pamoja" dream is looking more like "Pamoja Tutaumia." This week, the inspection at Kasarani was a total circus. How are we hosting a continental tournament when the only thing ready is the VIP lounge for the big fish to sit and sip tea? 

Imagine! **William Ruto** was there with his usual "mambo ni matatu" energy, telling us the stadium will be ready "by yesterday." Mr. President, please! We can see the cement mixers are stuck in 2024. The PR is top-tier, but the ground is screaming "Character Development!"

## Riggy G and the "Mountain" of Excuses
And then we have **Rigathi Gachagua**. You guys, I can’t! Instead of talking about the drainage system or the VAR technology we supposedly bought, the Deputy President spent half the presser talking about how "certain people" from the mountain are being sidelined in the construction tenders. Kwani is it a football pitch or a tribal meeting? 

Riggy G, we don't care who gets the tender as long as the grass is green and not painted khaki! The way he was hovering around the site looking confused, you’d think he was looking for a misplaced bag of maize instead of a world-class locker room. 

## Raila is Watching from the VAR Room
Of course, **Raila Odinga** couldn't stay away. Baba showed up looking like a retired coach, giving "expert advice" that nobody asked for. He was seen shaking his head at the goalposts, probably thinking about how he could have done it better if the "handshake" was still a thing. 

The audacity! Raila is basically the VAR of Kenyan politics—always checking for fouls but never actually playing the game. He’s out here critiquing the pitch while his own "Baba’s fans" are wondering if they’ll even afford tickets in 2027. Sasa, is this a sports inspection or a campaign rally for 2027? 

## Eric Omondi vs The Bulldozers
Now, enter the President of Comedy—or is it President of Poverty? **Eric Omondi** decided that the best way to protest the slow progress was to chain himself to a goalpost. Wueh! The drama! He was shirtless (as usual, kwani he doesn't own a hoodie?), screaming about how the youth are being scammed while the sports fund is being eaten by "cartels." 

While his heart might be in the right place, seeing Eric being dragged away by police while crying about "the future of our stars" was the peak comedy we didn't ask for. Is it activism or just another skit for likes? Either way, he made more noise than the actual construction workers.

## Khaligraph Jones: The Buff Bodyguard of "Talanta"
And why was **Khaligraph Jones** there? Imagine, the OG was brought in to "inspect" the acoustics for the opening ceremony. Seeing the OG walking around the dusty site in a designer suit, looking like he’s about to punch the contractor, was the highlight of my week. 

Khaligraph, we love the bars, but unless you’re going to use those muscles to carry those bags of cement yourself, please stay in the studio! The "Talanta Hela" hype is slowly becoming "Talanta Hela-Less." If we don't get our act together, the only thing we'll be hosting in 2027 is a pity party. 

Kenya, we are failing. The tea is bitter, the stadiums are imaginary, and the leaders are just influencers in suits. Muache mchezo!
