Kenya, jo, nchi ya kusurvive. Sai ni kama kila politician anajua tu ku-talk about economy but vitu zinakaa tu zile zile. But, walae, this time kuna something different.

**The Scoop**
Imagine, U.S. Supreme Court wameamua kucheza kama wao! Wame-strike down global tariffs previously imposed by President Donald Trump. Hii ni kama huge boost for Kenya and other countries trading with the U.S. The decision dropped on Friday, manze, exactly when Kenya sends a delegation to Washington to negotiate a new trade deal. Big welcome for Kenyans exporting apparel to the U.S. market.

**The Evidence**
Kwanza Trump alipiga nations zetu 10% tariff April 2025, kama kofi. Hii ilikuwa significant shift from the duty-free access these nations previously enjoyed under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had exempted most Kenyan exports from U.S. duties for more than two decades. Vitu kama textiles, coffee, na tea zilikuwa zimeumia vibaya. Other nations in the region, kama Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Tanzania, na Uganda, also faced the baseline 10% levy. Na hii ni relief, kwanza after zile stories za ati [AI Imewashtua Biz Ndogo za Nairobi! M-Pesa Data Sasa Ni Chwani za Insights?](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/ai-shtua-biz-ndogo-nairobi-mpesa-data-chwani-insights) - jo, small businesses need all the breaks they can get.

So, the superior court ruled that Trump acted beyond his powers when he hit other nations with the tariffs. Hii 10% "baseline" tariff sasa invalid! This means Kenyan goods like apparel, textiles, and coffee can once again enter the U.S. market duty-free. Hii ni kumaanisha approximately 66,000 to 70,000 direct jobs na about Ksh95 billion annually are safe, at least for now. Hii ruling imekuja against the backdrop of the AGOA deal that was recently given a lifeline on January 12 by the U.S., following months of negotiations.

**The Verdict**
With AGOA extended and now these tariffs gone, the government has already indicated that investors now have greater certainty regarding continued access to the American market. Hii ni hata kama Kenya pushes for a more comprehensive bilateral trade arrangement. Kwanza the Trump administration wamesema watatafuta ways to impose the levies legally, but for now, textile na apparel sector zimepumua. Tutaona kama hii ni mwanzo mzuri ama ni kucopy-paste tu.
