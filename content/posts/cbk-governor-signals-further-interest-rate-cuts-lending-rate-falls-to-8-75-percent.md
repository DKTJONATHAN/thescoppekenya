## CBK Governor Signals Further Interest Rate Cuts as Lending Rate Falls to 8.75 Percent

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor has indicated potential for additional interest rate reductions, following a series of cuts that have brought the benchmark lending rate to 8.75 percent. This easing cycle aims to stimulate economic activity and support growth in Kenya.

### The Rationale Behind Further Interest Rate Cuts

Dr. Kamau Thugge, the current CBK Governor who assumed office in June 2023, informed Bloomberg on Wednesday that the Central Bank still possesses the capacity to further decrease its benchmark rate. This follows ten consecutive reductions over the last year and a half, initiatives designed to invigorate economic activity. The aggressive easing cycle has seen the Central Bank Rate (CBR) descend from a 12-year peak of 13 percent in June 2024 to its current 8.75 percent.

Governor Thugge elaborated that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), scheduled to convene again in April, would contemplate additional reductions if global conditions remain stable and inflationary pressures stay contained. He affirmed that prevailing conditions enable the bank to foster growth without inciting price instability. The policy direction, he explained, is informed by an existing output gap, indicating that the economy is still operating below its full growth potential. In such circumstances, central banks typically lower borrowing costs to encourage investment, consumption, and expansion within the private sector.

### Economic Potential and the Lending Rate

"We are still not at full potential growth," Thugge stated during the interview, underscoring the gap between the economy's optimal state and its current performance. This commitment to achieving full economic potential underpins the CBK's dovish stance on monetary policy. The recent 25 basis point cut earlier this month, which lowered the CBR to 8.75 percent, was specifically aimed at boosting private sector lending.

Recent data indicates an improvement in private sector credit growth, reaching 6.4 percent in January 2026. This growth is bolstered by robust demand across key sectors such as construction, trade, and household consumption. Concurrently, commercial bank lending rates have marginally decreased, averaging 14.8 percent compared to 15.0 percent in October 2025. The full implementation of the Risk-Based Credit Pricing Model in March 2026 is expected to enhance transparency in loan pricing and further invigorate credit growth.

### Navigating Global Headwinds Amidst Falling Lending Rate

Despite the optimistic outlook for further interest rate cuts, Governor Thugge cautioned that external risks could complicate the easing trajectory. Geopolitical tensions, including trade tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, and instability in the Middle East, which could disrupt global oil prices, remain significant concerns. These factors introduce an element of uncertainty into the otherwise stable domestic economic environment.

Kenya’s sustained easing cycle, marked by the December 2025 cut that brought the benchmark rate to 9.0 percent, has been facilitated by moderating inflation and a more stable global commodities market. Experts anticipate this trend will translate into more affordable personal loans, business financing, and mortgages, provided banks effectively pass on these benefits to consumers.

### Future Outlook for Kenya's Interest Rate Cuts

Across Africa, Kenya is among several economies projected to continue easing monetary policy as inflationary pressures subside. However, economists advise that most central banks are likely to proceed cautiously as they approach the culmination of their rate-cutting cycles. For Kenya, the next MPC meeting in April will be crucial in determining the immediate future of the lending rate.

As the nation looks forward to sustained economic momentum, it is also celebrating its achievements on other fronts.
