Alright, so here's the real talk, manze: it's wild how we always wait for things to nearly collapse before we start making noise. Mimi huona tu, this Kasarani Aquatic Complex issue isn't even new, bana. Tunajifanya kushangaa lakini deep down tunajua sometimes serikali yetu, eish, wamelala kweli.

**The Scoop: Kasarani Pool Is Kicking the Bucket, Jo!**

So, Kenya Aquatics Technical Director Omar Omari just dropped a bombshell, sounding the alarm about the Kasarani Aquatic Complex. He's saying the place is falling apart because of poor maintenance, and it's seriously messing with our swimmers' chances and Kenya's global sports ambitions. He spoke at the end of the Kenya Aquatics Long Course Championships huko Nairobi, stressing that this facility is a national treasure that we *have* to save for the future of the sport. Imagine, this is the *only* Olympic-size swimming pool in East Africa, a major source of pride, and a training hub for not just our Kenyan athletes, but also swimmers from at least eight neighbouring countries who come here for camps.

Omar Omari was quoted by The Star, begging Sports Kenya to keep the pool in good shape. “My plea to Sports Kenya is to make sure the pool remains in good condition," he said, adding, "This is the only Olympic-size swimming pool in East Africa, and a source of pride for the swimming community.”. He's right though, ati letting such a strategic place go to waste would have huge consequences. "We cannot afford to neglect such an important facility. Someone somewhere is sleeping on the job,” he fired, noting that this poor upkeep is stifling talent and even cutting off economic opportunities from sports tourism and regional competitions.

**The Evidence: Olympics in Jeopardy?**

Even with all this drama, Omari is still optimistic about Kenya's swimming future. He even laid out a plan to build a competitive squad for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. He's convinced that if all stakeholders pull together in the next year and a half, and coaching standards improve, we can actually produce world-class swimmers who meet those A and B qualification standards. Manze, you'd think facilities this crucial for national pride and sports tourism would be top tier, but wapi! Sometimes unajiuliza kama tuna take things serious enough huku kwetu, like, tunajua [Kenyan Women Live Longer, But What's The Catch?](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/kenyan-women-longer-life-preventable-deaths), which is great, but then you hear stories like this and you just wonder if we're really tackling the root causes of our problems.

Meanwhile, the Long Course Championships just wrapped up, and Braeburn Swim Club killed it, topping the medal standings with 29 gold, 15 silver, and 17 bronze. Sea Horses Aquatics came in second with 53 medals overall (18 gold, 25 silver, 10 bronze), and Mombasa Aquatics snagged third with 15 gold, 17 silver, and seven bronze. Impressive stuff from 56 teams across the country!

**The Verdict: Get Your Papers in Order!**

Kenya Aquatics president Maureen Owiti also chimed in, saying that qualification standards for upcoming international assignments - kama the Africa Aquatics junior, senior, and masters championships in Ghana in May, and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow - will be announced soon. She's calling on clubs, coaches, and swimmers to make sure their federation membership is up to date, even telling masters swimmers to regularize their records before selection. Next up on the calendar? The National Masters Swimming Championships in April and the Junior Championships in August, both set to go down kwa Mombasa. Walae, let's hope someone wakes up and fixes this Kasarani issue before our Olympic dreams turn into Olympic memes.
