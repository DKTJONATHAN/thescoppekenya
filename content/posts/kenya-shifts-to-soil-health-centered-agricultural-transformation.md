## Kenya Shifts to Soil-Health-Centered Agricultural Transformation

Kenya is implementing a significant pivot towards soil-health-centered agricultural transformation, a strategic move designed to enhance crop yields, reduce reliance on costly chemical fertilizers, and bolster resilience against the impacts of climate change. This new approach represents a fundamental shift in national agricultural policy.

### The Imperative for Soil-Health-Centered Agricultural Transformation

For years, Kenyan smallholder farmers have grappled with declining soil quality, climate-related land degradation, and escalating production costs, despite considerable public spending on fertilizer subsidies. Experts have long cautioned that fertilizer application alone cannot reverse diminishing yields if underlying soil health issues are not addressed. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization's Status of the World’s Soil Resources Report, nearly a third of global soils are moderately to highly degraded due to erosion, nutrient depletion, and mismanagement.

The new direction aligns with the broader Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan under the Nairobi Declaration, which emerged from the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit in May 2024. This declaration outlines commitments to enhance agricultural productivity by improving soil health across Africa, marking a paradigm shift towards integrated, sustainable approaches emphasizing soil health and precision agriculture.

### Key Pillars of Kenya's New Agricultural Transformation

The government’s new strategy, formally adopting the Kenya Fertilizer and Soil Health (KFSH) Action Plan 2026-2035, is anchored in Kenya's Agricultural Soil Management Policy (2023) and emphasizes responsible fertilizer use, mandatory soil testing, and region-specific agronomic advice. This initiative is supported by the World Bank Group's Impact Program on Repurposing Agriculture Support for Soil Health, which aims to help countries like Kenya transition from blanket fertilizer subsidies to targeted, soil-health-driven agricultural support systems. The program, launched in February 2026, focuses on strengthening soil data systems, improving extension services, promoting balanced nutrient management, and ensuring public funds are used more efficiently.

Under this strategy, farmers are set to benefit from expanded soil testing and mapping services that will identify their land's specific nutrient needs. The government is also digitizing soil data to guide precise fertilizer application, enabling farmers to use the correct type and quantity of inputs, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach. Principal Secretary for Agriculture Dr. Paul Ronoh has been instrumental in advancing digital agriculture initiatives and integrating soil data systems to guide smarter input use.

Complementing these efforts, the European Union launched a Sh645 million (approximately US$4.6 million) soil health and agroecology program in January 2026, targeting 40,000 farmers in six counties over three years. This program, implemented with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), aims to strengthen climate-resilient agriculture and farmer incomes, directly supporting the national agenda for soil health. Dr. Ronoh also recently launched an Agripreneur Extension Program in February 2026, further modernizing advisory services for farmers.

### Moving Beyond Blanket Subsidies for Agricultural Transformation

While Kenya continues to implement fertilizer subsidy programs, the emphasis is now on a more targeted, science-driven approach. Principal Secretary Dr. Paul Ronoh recently flagged off the 2026 Long Rains National Fertiliser Subsidy Programme in January 2026, distributing three million bags of fertilizer with a capped price of KSh 2,500 per bag. He highlighted that the current batch of fertilizer is specifically tailored to various regions, crops, and soil types, demonstrating the ongoing shift towards precision agriculture even within subsidy schemes. This approach is designed to reduce waste, lower costs, and sustainably improve productivity.

The government's new direction signals a transition from generalized subsidies to targeted, data-driven support, a move officials believe will safeguard public spending while delivering better results at the farm level. The goal is to move from short-term yield boosts to long-term agricultural sustainability, redefining support for millions of smallholder farmers.

### The Path Ahead for Kenya's Soil-Health-Centered Approach

If successfully implemented, this soil-health-centered model holds the potential to significantly increase farmer incomes, restore degraded land, and build climate-resilient farming systems across the country. By focusing on soil as the fundamental basis of productivity, Kenya is positioning its agricultural sector for sustained growth and food security for its growing population.
