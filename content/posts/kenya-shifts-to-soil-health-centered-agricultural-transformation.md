## Kenya Shifts to Soil-Health-Centered Agricultural Transformation for Sustainable Growth

Kenya is implementing a new government strategy focused on soil health to transform agriculture across the nation. This move aims to significantly improve crop yields, reduce the high costs associated with chemical fertilizers, and enhance farming systems' resilience against the increasing impacts of climate change.

The government's commitment to this strategic shift is evident through its participation in the World Bank Group’s Impact Program on Repurposing Agriculture Support for Soil Health, which was launched in February 2026. This program seeks to help countries like Kenya transition from costly blanket fertilizer subsidies to targeted, soil-health-driven agricultural support systems. Kenya is one of the participating countries in this World Bank initiative, alongside Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia.

### The Imperative for Soil-Health-Centered Agricultural Transformation

For many years, smallholder farmers in Kenya have relied on subsidized fertilizers to increase production. However, agricultural experts note that fertilizer alone cannot effectively address declining yields if the underlying soil health is poor. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization's Status of the World’s Soil Resources Report, nearly a third of global soils are moderately to highly degraded due to issues like erosion, nutrient depletion, and acidification. Applying fertilizer without restoring soil organic matter often leads to diminishing returns and continued yield decline.

Kenya continues to face challenges such as declining soil quality, climate-related land degradation, and rising production costs, despite substantial public spending on fertilizer subsidies. The effectiveness of past support programs has been limited by broad subsidy schemes that strain public finances, weak integration of soil data into advisory services, and insufficient extension capacity. Inefficiencies in input markets and erratic rainfall further compound these issues.

### A New Direction for Kenya's Soil Health

The Principal Secretary for Agriculture, Dr. Paul Ronoh, has reaffirmed Kenya’s commitment to moving away from generalized fertilizer subsidies towards a more targeted, science-driven approach focused on restoring soil fertility. This new direction aligns with the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan under the Nairobi Declaration, emphasizing sustainable productivity, climate resilience, and more prudent use of public resources to directly benefit farmers. The Nairobi Declaration, a key outcome of the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit held in May 2024, outlines commitments to enhance agricultural productivity by improving soil health across the continent. Kenya is actively in the process of formally adopting its own Kenya Fertilizer and Soil Health (KFSH) Action Plan 2026-2035, which translates this continental agenda into practical national strategies and is anchored in the country's Agricultural Soil Management Policy (2023).

Under Kenya's new strategy, farmers are expected to benefit from expanded soil testing and mapping services, which will help identify the specific nutrient needs of their land. The government is also digitizing soil data to guide precise fertilizer application, enabling farmers to use the right type and quantity of inputs, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach. This shift towards balanced nutrient management and targeted government support based on actual soil conditions is designed to improve yields, reduce input costs, and promote long-term soil fertility.

### Strengthening Agricultural Transformation through Collaboration

Kenya has already finalized a Fertilizer and Soil Health Strategy and begun integrating soil data systems to guide smarter input use. Dr. Ronoh highlighted that this approach will help farmers use the correct type and amount of fertilizer for their specific soil conditions, thereby reducing waste, lowering costs, and improving productivity sustainably.

To further bolster these efforts, Dr. Ronoh has urged stronger collaboration with the World Bank to finance a national digital soil information system, strengthen agricultural extension services, and support private-sector input markets. He also emphasized the need to restructure existing agricultural projects to better address farmers’ immediate needs while building long-term resilience. Beyond national efforts, other initiatives are also contributing to soil health in Kenya. For instance, in January 2026, the EU and IFAD launched a US$4.6 million soil health and agroecology program targeting 40,000 smallholder farmers across six counties to strengthen climate-ready farming and farmer incomes. Additionally, Farm Africa's "Strengthening Regenerative Agriculture in Kenya" (STRAK) project has shown significant success, with participating farmers reporting up to 81% higher yields and 92% improvement in water retention through regenerative practices.

This new direction signals Kenya's transition from generalized subsidies to targeted, data-driven support, a move officials believe will safeguard public spending while delivering better results at the farm level. If successfully implemented, this soil-health-centered model could significantly increase farmer incomes, restore degraded land, and build climate-resilient farming systems across the country. By focusing on soil as the foundation of productivity, Kenya aims to shift from short-term yield boosts to long-term agricultural sustainability, a change that could redefine support for millions of smallholder farmers. Such a profound shift requires consistent political will and a focus on long-term national benefit, a principle essential for ensuring that [Kenya Deserves Better: Power-Hungry Syndicates Passing Off as Political Parties Undermine Democracy](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenya-deserves-better-power-hungry-syndicates-political-parties) do not derail vital development agendas.
