## Simi Old Tweets Controversy Explodes

Nigerian singer Simi faces intense backlash after old 2012 tweets resurfaced, with fans demanding she apologize fully and vanish from social media.

## The Offensive Tweets

At 23, while working at her mother's daycare, Simi joked online about a 4-year-old boy named David having a "crush" on her. She wrote about him wanting to "lock lips" and resting his head on her lap, playfully asking if she should "give him a chance."

The posts blew up recently amid her advocacy against rape and child abuse cases in Nigeria.

## Simi's Response

Simi defended the tweets as innocent humor from her daycare days, saying they've been twisted out of context. She claims she's never been "depraved" and had some posts deleted to protect her family, but stands by her anti-violence stance.

## Fan Fury Led by Ijeoma Njoku

Ijeoma Njoku went viral calling out Simi for owning the tweets without remorse, labeling them "pedophilic" and indefensible from a grown adult. Njoku, who's spoken on child rape issues, demands Simi deactivate X, apologize properly, and disappear.

Many echo this, rejecting the "12 years ago" excuse since Simi wasn't a teen.

## Split Reactions

Some defend Simi, arguing early 2010s Twitter humor was edgier and context matters. Others, including influencers like Daniel Regha, slam her defense as minimizing perversion.

The drama highlights how past posts haunt celebrities, especially advocates, fueling cancel culture debates in Nigerian entertainment.
