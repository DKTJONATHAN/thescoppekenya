## Turkana, Homa Bay County Governments Implement Salary Increase for Employees

The county governments of Turkana and Homa Bay have confirmed the implementation of a salary increase for their employees, effective with the February 2026 payroll. This adjustment aligns with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission's (SRC) 3rd Salary Review, offering long-awaited relief to thousands of county staff.

The announcement marks a significant development for **county government employees** in both Turkana and Homa Bay. The revised pay structures, reflecting the 3rd Salary Review by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC), are now visible in the February 2026 payslips. This move follows months of anticipation by workers across various county departments. While international spectacles like the Women's World Cup 2023 capture global attention, policy decisions such as this have a direct and tangible impact on the daily lives of public servants, underscoring the importance of local governance.

### Details of the Salary Increase for Employees in Turkana and Homa Bay

In Homa Bay County, Bernard Muok, the County Head of Public Service, issued a notice confirming that the February 2026 payslips reflect the new salary structure. Muok emphasised that these adjustments are part of approved national government policy directives aimed at enhancing the earnings of **county government workers**. Employees have been advised to meticulously review their February payslips and seek clarification from the Directorate of Human Resource Management and Development if necessary. Bernard Muok was nominated to his current position as county secretary and head of public service in October 2022.

Similarly, the Turkana County Government communicated that the approved salary review for the 2024/2025 financial year has now been effected, with the revised pay structure taking effect from February 2026. An internal memo from the Office of the County Secretary reiterated the county's commitment to adhering to SRC circulars and broader public service remuneration guidelines, alongside prioritising staff welfare.

### The Role of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) in County Remuneration

The Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) plays a constitutional role, established under Article 230, to set and regularly review the remuneration and benefits for state officers and advise on those of other public officers, including **county government employees**. The 3rd remuneration and benefits review cycle, which spans the period 2021/2022-2024/2025, involves comprehensive processes such as job evaluation, grading, and labour market salary surveys.

Historically, the implementation of SRC's recommendations for county workers has faced challenges. In September 2025, county workers reportedly missed out on a KSh 4.7 billion pay rise for the year to June 2025, with governors citing a lack of financial resources. This previous delay highlights the significance of the current announcement by the **Turkana, Homa Bay County Governments**, as it signals a successful navigation of the fiscal and administrative hurdles that often impede such adjustments.

### Broader Implications for County Government Employees and Fiscal Sustainability

The implementation of this **salary increase for employees** in Turkana and Homa Bay is expected to bolster morale and potentially enhance productivity within the county public service. It also underscores the ongoing efforts to harmonise compensation structures across the public sector in line with national policy directives. The SRC's periodic reviews are crucial for ensuring equity, fiscal sustainability, and alignment with the national wage bill framework.

While the national government has recently approved a revised salary and leave allowance structure for its civil servants as part of the fourth remuneration review cycle (2025-2029) to be implemented from July 1, 2025, the current action by the **Turkana, Homa Bay County Governments** pertains specifically to the earlier, 3rd review cycle for county staff. This phased approach to remuneration adjustments across different tiers of government reflects the complexities of managing Kenya's public wage bill while addressing the welfare of its vast workforce.
