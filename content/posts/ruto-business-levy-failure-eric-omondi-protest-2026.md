## The Ghetto Is On Fire, Literally!
Wueh! Grab your mugs because this week the tea is piping hot and it tastes like high taxes and broken dreams. We are barely two months into 2026, and the "Hustler" narrative has officially undergone the most painful Character Development in Kenyan history. While William Ruto was at State House this morning talking about "macro-economic stability" like he’s reading a fairy tale, the actual ground is screaming. 

Kwani, does the President live in the same Kenya as us? This week’s "Creative Economy Business Levy" is the final nail in the coffin. You want to tax influencers, barbers, and mama mbogas until they bleed? Sasa basi, the economy isn't growing; it’s gasping for air!

## Gachagua and the ‘Shareholder’ Delusion
And don’t even get me started on Rigathi Gachagua. The Deputy President decided to open his mouth again—imagine!—reminding everyone that those who didn’t vote for this "company" shouldn't expect business tenders. Riggy G is out here acting like the national treasury is his personal Kambaatara fund. He’s busy telling us that the "Truthful Man" doesn't lie, but the only truth we see is that our bank accounts are in the ICU. Someone tell him that business doesn't care about "shares" when the cost of electricity is higher than his political ambitions!

## Eric Omondi vs. The System
While the politicians are playing golf, Eric Omondi is back in his element. This week, the "President of Comedy" turned "President of the Streets" was spotted at City Hall with a chain around his neck and a bunch of struggling youth. He’s calling out the government for making it impossible to run a kiosk in this city without paying eighteen different "protection" taxes. Say what you want about Eric, but at least he’s not sitting in a boardroom eating samosas while the youth are eating dust. He’s out here showing us that "Hustler" was just a campaign slogan, not a business plan.

## Where is Agwambo?
Raila Odinga, as usual, is playing the long game of "I told you so." He’s been moving around with that mysterious smile, watching the Kenya Kwanza house burn from the inside. Baba dropped a tweet this week about "Economic Sabotage" that had the whole of X (formerly Twitter) in a frenzy. But let’s be real—while Raila watches, the OG himself, Khaligraph Jones, is actually feeling the pinch. 

## Even the OG is Crying!
Imagine, even Khaligraph Jones had to post a video complaining about the cost of running his car collection and his studio business. When the OG—the man who literally breathes confidence—starts asking "Kwani tunaelekea wapi?", you know the business environment is cooked. If a whole Papa Jones is feeling the heat of the fuel prices and the new "Luxury Business Tax," what about the small guy in River Road? 

The bottom line? The government is treating the private sector like a lemon they can keep squeezing, but they’ve forgotten that if you squeeze too hard, the seeds will pop out and hit you in the eye. Ruto and Gachagua need to wake up before Eric Omondi decides to bring his "coffins" straight to the Parliament gates. Tea served!
