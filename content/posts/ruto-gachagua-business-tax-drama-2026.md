## Wueh! Is This a Government or a Shylock?

Sasa basi, grab your stools and some cold water because the tea today is boiling hot and it tastes like betrayal! We are only three days into February 2026, and President William Ruto has already decided that the only thing Kenyans should be heart-broken by this month isn't their exes, but their bank balances. 

Imagine! This week, the "Hustler-in-Chief" officially signed the *Small Business Sustainability Act*, which is just a fancy government term for "give us your last coin." If you thought the Finance Acts of 2023 and 2024 were bad, honey, you haven't seen anything yet. Zakayo is truly living up to his name, and the character development we are seeing in this country is wilder than a Telenovela.

## Riggy G and the "Mt. Kenya" Confusion

Meanwhile, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua is somewhere in Central Kenya trying to convince us that this new tax is actually "maize flour in disguise." Like, kwani? Does he think we don't have calculators? Riggy G has been shouting about "shareholders" for three years, but right now, even the shareholders are looking for the nearest exit. He’s out here defending a levy that targets the very "Mama Mbogas" he promised to protect. The math is not mathing, and the vibes are strictly "every man for himself."

## Raila’s "Handshake" Silence is Deafening

And where is Baba? Raila Odinga is supposedly busy with his AU business, but the streets are talking. While the business community is bleeding, Raila’s silence is giving "I told you so" mixed with "I'm also on the payroll." One day he’s the people’s watchman, the next day he’s having tea at State House while our businesses are being auctioned. The political gymnastics deserve an Olympic gold medal at this point. 

## Eric Omondi vs. The Whole System

But wait! The award for the most dramatic week goes to Eric Omondi. Wueh! This man has officially transitioned from a comedian to a full-blown headache for the government. He was spotted this morning outside the National Treasury with a coffin labeled "Small Business 1963-2026." Say what you want about his theatrics, but at least he’s not sitting in a boardroom eating biscuits while the economy collapses. He’s out there screaming for the youth who can’t even afford a business permit anymore because Ruto wants a piece of every "Sura Yako" brand deal.

## Khaligraph Jones is About to Drop a KRA Diss Track

Even the OG, Khaligraph Jones, isn't silent this time. The man who usually minds his "Blue Subarus" and gym sessions is feeling the pinch. Word on the street is that the new "Creative Digital Levy" has hit the music industry so hard that even the rappers are considering becoming farmers—but oh wait, there’s a tax for that too! Jones took to Instagram to remind the powers that be that "Heshima idumu," but how can respect remain when the taxman is literally sleeping in our wallets?

The tea is simple: The government is broke, the citizens are tired, and the "Hustler" dream has officially become a nightmare. If you’re planning to start a business in Kenya this week, maybe just buy a lottery ticket instead. It’s safer.

Sasa basi, what do you think? Is Ruto fixing the economy or just fixing our pockets? Let’s talk in the comments!
