## NTSA Pressured to Scrap Court Fines for Instant Mobile Money Payments

The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) is currently under significant pressure from the Kenya Transporters Association (KTA) to expedite the full implementation of instant traffic fines payable through mobile money. This initiative aims to streamline traffic enforcement, decongest courts, and mitigate corruption, coinciding with the NTSA's active rollout of a KSh 42 billion digital enforcement system.

### The Push to Scrap Court Fines for Minor Offences

The Kenya Transporters Association (KTA) has formally urged President William Ruto, the Chief Justice, the Inspector General of Police, and the NTSA to embrace an immediate, on-the-spot traffic fine system, eliminating the conventional court-based approach for minor infractions. In a letter dated February 24, 2026, KTA Chairman Newton Wang'oo highlighted that the existing court system is both inefficient and costly, often leading to significant backlogs and unnecessary financial burdens on motorists and enforcement agencies. The association argues that many minor and administrative traffic offences are unnecessarily channelled through the courts, resulting in repeated appearances and wasted time.

This advocacy aligns with the government's broader digital transformation agenda, as the NTSA has recently unveiled an ambitious plan to modernise traffic enforcement. On February 24, 2026, NTSA announced a KSh 42 billion Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with KCB Bank Kenya Limited and Pesa Print Limited. This 21-year project involves the deployment of 1,000 smart speed cameras across major highways and high-risk areas, comprising 700 fixed and 300 mobile units. These cameras are designed to capture violations in real-time, feeding data to a National Command and Control Centre for automated detection and immediate issuance of penalties.

### Instant Mobile Money Payments to Enhance Efficiency and Combat Corruption

A core component of the KTA's proposal and the NTSA's new system is the integration of instant payment channels, particularly through mobile money platforms. The NTSA's digital ecosystem will support payments via mobile money, USSD, and banking channels, allowing motorists to settle fines promptly without the need for court appearances or visits to police stations. KTA posits that this digital payment mechanism would significantly curb opportunities for corruption by ensuring penalties are remitted directly to official government accounts, thereby minimising leakages associated with cash-based transactions. This move is seen as a "low-hanging reform with high impact," aligning with government priorities on digital governance and anti-corruption.

The NTSA has already published a comprehensive list of 37 traffic offences, with instant fines ranging from KSh 500 to KSh 10,000, under the Traffic (Minor Offences) Rules 2016. Offences such as driving without identification plates, driving without a valid inspection certificate, or causing obstruction on the road will attract a KSh 10,000 fine. Minor infractions like failing to renew a driving licence or carrying more than one pillion passenger on a motorcycle will incur a KSh 1,000 fine. The system is also expected to link violations to smart driving licences, which will incorporate a merit and demerit points system.

### Broader Impact of Digital Transformation in Traffic Enforcement

The transition to instant digital fines is anticipated to decongest judicial systems by allowing minor offences to be resolved administratively, freeing up magistrates and prosecutors to focus on more serious cases. This reform is also projected to improve road discipline, reduce accidents, and enhance the efficiency of government revenue collection. NTSA statistics indicate a concerning rise in road fatalities, with crashes costing the country an estimated KSh 450 billion annually, underscoring the urgency of these enforcement measures.

This digitisation push reflects a broader national embrace of technology to enhance operational efficiency and accountability across various public services. While the government focuses on these critical reforms, public discourse also engages with the economic and logistical considerations of other national engagements. For instance, the discussion surrounding the financial outlay for major public events often prompts Kenyans to consider the real cost of national endeavors.

The new enforcement framework is a significant step towards modernising Kenya's transport sector, with the NTSA actively deploying infrastructure and implementing regulations to support this shift. The success of this initiative hinges on seamless integration of technology and widespread public adoption of the instant payment systems.
