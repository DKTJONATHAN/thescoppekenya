## Wueh! Is it Football or Sherehe?
Kwani what is happening with our national team? Imagine, while Coach is out here screaming his lungs out at Kasarani, our very own "Golden Boy"—the striker we are all banking on to take us to the 2027 AFCON—was spotted far away from the pitch. 

The Tea Master has receipts, and darling, they are steaming hot! While the Harambee Stars camp was reporting "minor injuries" as the reason for his absence from the morning session, our paps spotted the star in Diani. And no, he wasn't doing physical therapy on the sand. He was busy serving "Instagram Husband" vibes for a certain well-known socialite whose name rhymes with 'expensive'! 

## The Mystery 'Bestie' and the Missing Boots
Imagine the audacity! The rest of the mbogi is out here drinking nothing but water and electrolytes, but our guy was seen sipping something fancy with a little umbrella in it. Sources close to the hotel say the two have been inseparable since Friday. 

The big question is: Does the FKF (Football Kenya Federation) know about this "private recovery session"? Or is the "injury" just a code word for "I need a bae-cation"? Wueh, the drama is real! If we lose the match on Wednesday, we know exactly who to blame, and it won't be the referee!

## Fans are Fuming!
Social media is already on fire. Some fans are saying, "Acha kijana ajivinjari," but the majority are asking, "Kwani we don't have discipline anymore?" You can’t be the face of Kenyan football and then be the face of Diani’s nightlife in the same week!

Siri ni, if you’re going to skip camp, at least don’t do it where people have iPhones! The Tea Master is watching. Will Coach drop him for the starting XI or will "talent" once again excuse bad manners? 

What do you think, my people? Is it time for some "tough love" for our stars, or should we let them enjoy their soft lives as long as they score? Drop your comments below before the tea gets cold!
