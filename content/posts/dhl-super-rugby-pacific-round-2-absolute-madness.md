## DHL Super Rugby Pacific Round 2: Try-Fests and Upsets!

Right, if you blinked this weekend, Mate, you might have missed a try or ten in the DHL Super Rugby Pacific Round 2. It was absolute madness on the pitches down under, with teams throwing everything but the kitchen sink at each other, leading to some truly high-scoring affairs and a few results that have certainly got the rumour mill churning.

### Absolute Madness Down Under, Mate!

Talk about a weekend for the attacking game! The scoreboards were working overtime, with the Hurricanes dishing out a proper thrashing to Moana Pasifika, a whopping 52-10, showcasing some serious firepower. And get this, the defending champions, the Crusaders, found themselves on the wrong end of a 50-24 hammering by the Brumbies in Christchurch. That’s not a typo, Mate, fifty points! Leaves the Crusaders winless so far, which, let's be honest, is a bit of a shocker for the faithful. The Blues also had a cracking match, overcoming the Force 42-32, proving that defence might just be an optional extra in this competition at times. The Waratahs got in on the action too, beating the Drua 36-13. Are we seeing a shift, or just a particularly wild round? Only time will tell, but it’s certainly got everyone talking.

### All Blacks Drama and Rising Stars

Beyond the Super Rugby chaos, the All Blacks camp has been a hive of activity, hasn't it? We've seen the team globe-trotting from Chicago to Edinburgh for their showdown with Scotland - proper VIP treatment, I'd say! Jordie Barrett's season-ending injury is a cruel blow, you've got to feel for the lad, while Damian McKenzie's 'massive impact off the bench in Edinburgh' just reminds us of his cheeky brilliance. And speaking of drama, you wouldn't believe the whispers flying around the locker rooms, almost as wild as some of those celebrity breakups, eh? What's really behind Dorea's silence amid all the speculation?

### Beyond the Pitch: Courage, History, and Global Reach

It’s not just about the men's game, either. Portia Woodman-Wickliffe, the absolute legend, is back from retirement in "Courage First," alongside rising star Braxton Sorensen-McGee. It’s all about the courage to return, to rise, and to face that gut-wrenching heartbreak of missing out on the PAC4 squad. Then there's the truly unexpected journey of New Zealand’s Under 85kg team heading to rugby-mad Sri Lanka. Police escorts, sold-out stadiums, media scrums - sounds like rockstar treatment for a bunch of lads who just love the game! And let's not forget our history; NZR+ inviting us to relive the "powerful chapters" with the "By the Balls" documentary. What a throwback! And for a real dose of nostalgia, the 1995 North v South clash where Jonah Lomu cemented his place in the Rugby World Cup squad - now that's a story worth revisiting.

### Crusaders' Conundrum and the Number 10 Battle

Back to the Super Rugby, and the Crusaders' early season woes are certainly a talking point. Their unbeaten home final streak was on the line against the Chiefs, and with that 50-24 thumping from the Brumbies, they're certainly feeling the heat. But perhaps the most intriguing battle is for their coveted No. 10 jersey in 2025. Three rising first-fives are vying for the spot, and then Wallabies great James O’Connor rocks up to the squad! Talk about adding a bit of spice, eh? It’s a fierce but respectful rivalry, apparently, with everyone "determined to make their mark." Who will take the reins? That’s "Next in Line" drama right there!

### Sevens Sizzling and Olympic Aspirations

Finally, a quick nod to the sevens circuit. The New Zealand teams reigned supreme in the first leg of the 2025/26 HSBC SVNS series. Proper dominance, that. But a stark reminder of the brutal nature of sport comes with Sarah Hirini’s story. At the peak of her career at the start of the 2024 season, brimming with Olympic optimism, only for a devastating knee injury to jeopardise her Paris aspirations. Is there enough time to recover? We’re all rooting for her, Mate. What a weekend for rugby, full of highs, lows, and plenty of talking points!
