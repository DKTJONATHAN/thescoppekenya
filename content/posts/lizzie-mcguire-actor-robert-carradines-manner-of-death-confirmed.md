## Lizzie McGuire Actor Robert Carradine's Manner of Death Confirmed

Authorities have officially confirmed the cause and manner of death for beloved "Lizzie McGuire" actor Robert Carradine, who passed away on Monday, February 23, 2026, at the age of 71. The confirmation reveals a tragic struggle with mental health, sending shockwaves through Hollywood and among his fans.

## A Candid Look at Robert Carradine's Manner of Death

The entertainment industry is grappling with the profound loss of Robert Carradine, best known for his roles in "Revenge of the Nerds" and as Hilary Duff's on-screen father in "Lizzie McGuire." Records from the County of Los Angeles Medical Examiner's office indicate the actor died at 71 from sequelae of anoxic brain injury and hanging on Monday, February 23, 2026. His manner of death has been officially listed as suicide, and he passed away in a hospital. This heartbreaking news comes just days before the current date, leaving fans and colleagues in deep mourning.

His family revealed to Deadline that Carradine had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder nearly two decades ago. They shared their grief, stating, "In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon of light to everyone around him. We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby's valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with bipolar disorder. We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness." The family has requested privacy during this unfathomable loss.

### Robert Carradine's Battle with Bipolar Disorder

The struggle with mental health, particularly bipolar disorder, was a significant part of Robert Carradine's life, as highlighted by his family. His brother, fellow actor Keith Carradine, spoke candidly about the condition, telling Deadline, "There is no shame in it. It is an illness that got the best of him, and I want to celebrate him for his struggle with it, and celebrate his beautiful soul. He was profoundly gifted, and we will miss him every day. We will take solace in how funny he could be, how wise and utterly accepting and tolerant he was. That's who my baby brother was." This emphasis on acknowledging mental illness underscores the importance of open conversations around such critical issues, not just in Hollywood but across all sectors.

The pressures and demands on individuals, whether in the spotlight or other high-stakes environments, can be immense. Much like the current challenges facing various sectors, from the "Sports Industry Faces Climate Crunch and Couch Potato Calamity," the entertainment world also navigates its own unique set of pressures, often silently.

## Tributes Pour In for the Beloved Lizzie McGuire Actor

The confirmation of Robert Carradine's passing has prompted an outpouring of tributes from his former costars, reflecting the deep impact he had on those he worked with. Hilary Duff, who played his daughter on the iconic Disney Channel series "Lizzie McGuire," expressed her profound sadness on Instagram. "This one hurts. It's really hard to face this reality about an old friend," Duff wrote. "There was so much warmth in the McGuire family, and I always felt so cared for by my onscreen parents. I'll be forever grateful for that. I'm deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him."

Jamie Lee Curtis, who dated Carradine early in her career, also shared a lengthy and poignant tribute on Facebook, mourning her "first love." She recalled their charming "meet-cute" on "The Dinah Shore Show," where Carradine rearranged seating to be next to her and kissed her live on television. Curtis concluded her heartfelt message, saying, "Rest in speed and humor and love, Bobby."
