## KFCB Calls for Tighter Parental Controls as Learners Return Home For Half-Term

The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) has intensified its call for tighter parental controls, urging parents and guardians to actively monitor and filter the content children consume during the current half-term break, a period when learners return home for at least a week. This advisory underscores the critical role families play in safeguarding minors from potentially harmful audio-visual content.

As students across Kenya settle in for their February mid-term break, the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) has issued a robust advisory emphasizing the urgent need for heightened parental oversight on media consumption. The notice, released on Thursday, February 26, appealed to parents, guardians, and caregivers to meticulously monitor the content accessed by learners through television, the internet, and other broadcasting channels. This proactive stance aligns with the Board's consumer advisory role, aiming to protect children from exposure to inappropriate and harmful materials.

### Ensuring Child Online Safety with Tighter Parental Controls

The KFCB's directive extends beyond passive monitoring, advocating for concrete measures to ensure child online safety. Parents are encouraged to implement screen time limits, thereby regulating the duration children spend on digital platforms and television. Crucially, the Board stressed the importance of utilising parental control features available on various devices, which can restrict access to content unsuitable for specific age groups. Furthermore, the advisory recommends setting strong passwords on Wi-Fi networks and other digital devices to bolster online security for children.

This timely intervention by the KFCB echoes broader concerns about digital hygiene and the pervasive nature of online content. Nairobi County's Chief Officer for Citizen Engagement and Customer Service, Geoffrey Mosiria, also issued a separate warning, specifically flagging platforms like Facebook where inappropriate advertisements reportedly bypass filters, reaching underage users. Such layered advisories highlight the growing complexity of protecting minors in an increasingly digital landscape.

### A Collective Responsibility as Learners Return Home

While individual parental action is paramount, the KFCB maintains that protecting learners from exposure to inappropriate content is a collective responsibility. The Board strongly advises parents to engage in co-viewing, watching content together with their children, and fostering meaningful discussions about what they are consuming. This approach moves beyond mere restriction, promoting media literacy and critical thinking from a young age.

Research consistently indicates that media content exerts a significant influence on consumer behaviour, particularly among children. The Board, established under the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222, is mandated to regulate the creation, broadcasting, possession, distribution, and exhibition of films and broadcast content to ensure conformity with national aspirations and cultural values, while crucially protecting children. This regulatory framework is fundamental to upholding societal standards and safeguarding the moral fabric of the nation.

Beyond digital content, the discussions parents initiate with their children during this period are vital for shaping their worldview and discernment. This extends to critically evaluating narratives and influences present in broader society. For instance, the discourse around public figures and their impact on societal values, as exemplified in discussions like [Pastor Ezekiel's Mockery of Higher Education: Troubling for a Developing Country's Future](https://zandani.co.ke/article/pastor-ezekiels-mockery-higher-education-troubling-developing-country), underscores the diverse sources of influence children navigate. Guiding children through such complexities is an integral part of ensuring their comprehensive protection and development.

The current half-term break offers an opportune moment for families to recalibrate their approach to media consumption. The emphasis on tighter parental controls and active engagement serves not only as a protective measure but also as a foundational step towards fostering responsible digital citizens in Kenya.
