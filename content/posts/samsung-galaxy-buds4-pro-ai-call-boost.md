## Samsung Galaxy Buds4 Pro and AI Call Boost Redefine Wireless Audio

Samsung has officially launched its highly anticipated Galaxy Buds4 Pro and the standard Buds4, introducing significant advancements in wireless audio technology. These new earbuds, unveiled at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on February 25, 2026, are designed to deliver exceptional sound quality, enhanced call clarity, and seamless integration with the broader Galaxy ecosystem. Pre-orders are currently open, with general availability commencing on March 11.

### Innovative Audio Engineering in the Galaxy Buds4 Pro

The Galaxy Buds4 Pro stands out with notable hardware enhancements, particularly a redesigned woofer. Samsung has widened this component while maintaining the overall earbud size, effectively increasing the speaker's vibration area by approximately 20% compared to the previous generation. This engineering translates to superior bass response and crisper high frequencies, with support for 24-bit/96 kHz audio on compatible Galaxy devices.

Both the Buds4 and Buds4 Pro incorporate Bluetooth 6.1, a recent standard released in May 2025, which brings improved privacy through randomized Resolvable Private Address (RPA) updates and enhanced power efficiency to connected devices. Alongside this, Samsung's proprietary SSC codec ensures high-quality wireless audio, complemented by standard AAC and SBC codecs for non-Samsung devices.

### Ergonomics and Intelligent Noise Cancellation

Samsung invested in extensive research, analyzing hundreds of millions of ear data points and conducting over 10,000 simulations, to craft an earbud shape that is both smaller and more stable. The Pro model features a canal-fit (in-ear) design for optimal sound isolation, while the standard Buds4 offers an open-fit design, catering to users who prefer less intrusive wear over extended periods. Both arrive in a new transparent clamshell case.

A significant upgrade in noise cancellation sees the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) system adjusting in real time. This adaptive technology considers individual ear shape and fit, moving beyond a generic algorithm to provide a personalized noise-blocking experience. Furthermore, the Buds4 Pro introduces Siren Detect, a safety feature that temporarily boosts ambient sound upon detecting emergency vehicle sirens or alarms, ensuring users remain aware of critical surroundings.

### The Power of AI Call Boost and Assistant Integration

Call quality receives a meaningful boost through Samsung's Super Clear Call feature. This innovation leverages super wideband audio and machine learning to effectively filter out background noise and enhance voice clarity. Wideband calls roughly double the audio frequency range of standard Bluetooth calls, resulting in noticeably more natural-sounding voices. This focus on clear communication is crucial in today's interconnected world.

For users within the Galaxy ecosystem, the Buds4 Pro offers hands-free access to AI assistants, including Bixby, Google Gemini, and Perplexity. This functionality allows users to interact with their AI assistant through head gestures and voice commands, eliminating the need to physically retrieve their phone. The integration of Perplexity, in particular, is a noteworthy development, as it is embedded at the system level within Galaxy AI on the new Galaxy S26 series, offering comprehensive AI capabilities accessible via voice commands like "Hey Plex" or a press of the side button.

As consumers increasingly demand seamless integration across their devices, it is worth noting the parallel advancements in smartphones. For instance, the recent buzz around the [Samsung Galaxy S26 Hits Ireland: What’s the Craic with All That AI?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/samsung-galaxy-s26-ireland-ai-details) highlights the broader trend of AI becoming central to our daily tech interactions.

### Battery Life and Durability

Battery performance for the Galaxy Buds4 Pro stands at 6 hours per charge with ANC activated, extending to 7 hours with ANC off. The charging case further boosts this to 26 and 30 hours, respectively. The standard Buds4 offers slightly less, with 5 hours of ANC-on listening and 24 hours total with the case.

Both models are built for resilience, with the Buds4 Pro boasting an IP57 water resistance rating, meaning it can withstand brief submersion. The standard Buds4 comes with an IP54 rating, offering protection against splashes and sweat.

The Galaxy Buds4 series, launching alongside the Galaxy S26, represents Samsung's continued commitment to pushing the boundaries of wearable technology, offering a blend of sophisticated audio, intelligent features, and robust design for the modern digital consumer.
