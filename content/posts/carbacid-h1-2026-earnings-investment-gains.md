## Carbacid H1 2026 Earnings: An Overview of Performance and Investment Gains

Carbacid Investments, a prominent food-grade carbon dioxide and dry ice manufacturer, recorded a 6.9% increase in its half-year profit, reaching KSh 464.96 million for the period ending January 31, 2026. This growth in Carbacid H1 2026 Earnings was primarily propelled by significant Investment Gains, even as the company experienced a moderation in its core operating momentum.

### Strategic Investment Gains Bolster Profitability

Carbacid Investments' balance sheet expanded to KSh 6.59 billion, a growth largely attributed to strategic investments in bonds and equities. This robust expansion of the balance sheet underscores the company's adeptness in leveraging non-operating assets to enhance overall profitability. The company’s closing stock price on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday, February 25, 2026, was KES 31.90, reflecting a 2.1% gain from its previous closing price. As of February 2026, Carbacid Investments Limited maintains a market capitalization of approximately KSh 8.13 billion on the NSE.

Revenue growth was anchored by stronger demand across East African markets, a positive indicator for regional economic activity. However, this strength was partially counteracted by subdued performance in Southern Africa, where seasonal factors and increased local supply negatively impacted volumes. This shift in sales mix exerted pressure on margins, coinciding with increased group spending. Administration costs rose by 15%, reflecting deliberate investments in customer retention and the systems necessary to support the company's longer-term strategy.

### Impact of Lower Interest Rates on Carbacid's Financials

The prevailing lower interest rate environment also influenced Carbacid's financial outcomes. Finance income saw a 3.6% decline to KSh 132.95 million, as returns on bonds and deposits eased. This reduction was, however, partially mitigated by decreased borrowing costs, as Carbacid continued to service debt incurred in earlier years for plant and logistics investments. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) lowered its benchmark interest rate to 8.75% on February 10, 2026, marking the tenth consecutive rate cut. This monetary policy adjustment, amid an annual inflation rate that eased to 4.4% in January 2026, creates a dynamic financial landscape for companies like Carbacid. Profit before tax still rose by 6.9% to KSh 619.95 million, though the quality of this growth increasingly leaned towards non-operating items, highlighting the critical role of Investment Gains.

### Operational Cash Flow and Future Payouts

Despite the positive headline profit figures from the Carbacid H1 2026 Earnings, cash generation was weaker during the period. Operating cash flow decreased by 24.2% to KSh 291.88 million. Furthermore, dividend payments amounting to KSh 475.83 million exceeded the cash generated from operations, leading to a decline in cash balances to KSh 88.13 million by the end of January, down from KSh 118.58 million six months prior. The board did not declare an interim dividend, indicating that any payout decision will be made following the full-year results.

The performance of Carbacid Investments in the first half of 2026 demonstrates a strategic pivot towards leveraging Investment Gains to sustain profitability amidst softening core operational momentum and a shifting interest rate environment. This approach will be crucial as the company navigates both domestic and regional market complexities.
