Walahi, siasa za Kenya ni kama movie, unaskianga tu vitu zingine weird kila siku. Kwanza politicians wetu wana-manage aje ku-balance emotional tributes na financial declarations kwa public forums? Manze, ni kama hakuna kitu ya siri tena.

The scoop ni hii: Mama Ida Odinga, akiwa vetted for the Kenya’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to UNEP position, amefunguka bana. Not only did she drop some heavy emotions about her late husband, Raila Amolo Odinga, but she also laid bare her personal net worth! The vetting session, which happened leo, February 20, ilikuwa full drama na figures, jo.

Appearing before the Departmental Committee on Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations, Ida alim-describe Raila kama "greatest pillar" throughout their 52-year marriage, akim-credit for supporting her ambitions. It was a heartfelt moment, especially considering Baba Raila passed away October 15, 2025. Alisema, “I want to make special mention of my partner and my friend. My biggest supporter, my recently departed husband, Raila Amolo Odinga, with whom I have been married for the last 52 years.” Walae, ilikuwa emotional.

But then, the conversation quickly shifted to finances, as required. When Nelson Koech, the committee chairperson, asked about her wealth, Ida haku-mince words. Alisema her personal net worth is about KSh 500 million! Hiyo ni half a billion shillings, bana. But kwanza, she clarified that this amount covers *only* what she personally owns, separating it from the wider Odinga family assets. “There are things that belong to me, Ida, and then there are things that belong to the Odinga family, which I also have an interest in, but my net worth is about Ksh500 million,” she said. It reminds you of how big money moves in this town, ati Nyota Progie Dosh Milioni Nyingi Hatarini, Billion Moja Inaweza Ku-Anguka Nayo!

If Parliament approves her appointment, Ida atachukua role kutoka kwa Ababu Namwamba, who was reassigned as Kenya’s High Commissioner to Uganda. UNEP, yenye iko headquartered hapa Nairobi, ni important sana kwa environmental policy globally, so this position ni heavyweight. President William Ruto ndiye alim-nominate Ida Odinga on January 23, 2026.

So, the verdict? It's clear that Mama Ida is ready to serve, and she's not shying away from the hard questions, even the ones about her deep personal loss or her hefty bank account. Kwanza, ku-declare hivi in public ni moves tu wachache wanaweza. It shows the kind of transparency, ama pressure, these public vetting processes put on our leaders. Whether it’s a good look or not, Kenyans on X wataamua!
