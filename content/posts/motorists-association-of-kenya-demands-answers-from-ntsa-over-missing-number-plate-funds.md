## Motorists Association of Kenya Demands Answers From NTSA Over Missing Number Plate Funds

The Motorists Association of Kenya (MAK) has intensified its demands for accountability from the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) regarding a persistent and crippling shortage of number plates, urging transparency over the substantial funds collected for these essential documents. The crisis, which has seen a backlog surpass 70,000 units, is primarily attributed to the National Treasury's delayed funding to NTSA, leaving suppliers unpaid and production stalled.

### Unpaid Suppliers and Missing Number Plate Funds Raise Alarm

The Motorists Association of Kenya issued a statement on Tuesday, February 24, highlighting the severe repercussions of the number plate deficit across the country. The association questions why vehicle owners consistently pay upfront fees for registration plates, and importers remit significant excise duties-sometimes equivalent to a vehicle's full Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value-yet the NTSA reportedly lacks the necessary funds for production. A digital plate for a motor vehicle costs Sh3,050, while motorcycle plates are Sh1,550, fees which Kenyans faithfully pay via the eCitizen portal, only to face indefinite delays.

"If citizens pay upfront for plates, and the government collects a heavy excise duty at the point of importation, how can there be no funds to produce number plates?" the Motorists Association stated, demanding a public accounting for where the collected funds have been allocated. This recurring issue, which has plagued Kenya since August 2024, with similar shortages in April and November 2025, points to a systemic breakdown in government procurement and fiscal management rather than isolated supply chain issues.

### Economic Paralysis and the Impact of the Number Plate Crisis

The far-reaching implications of the number plate shortage extend beyond mere inconvenience, paralysing various segments of the national economy. The current backlog includes approximately 51,000 motorcycles, 7,000 new cars, and 750 tuk-tuks, with specific production hitches affecting the KDV-W, X, Y, and Z series plates. Without physical number plates, banks are unable to process asset financing transfers, leading to new vehicles languishing in showrooms and loan paperwork stalling indefinitely.

Thousands of imported vehicles are currently stranded at the Port of Mombasa, unable to be released to dealers or buyers. This situation exacerbates financial losses throughout the automotive supply chain, impacting dealers who rely on sales and importers facing demurrage charges. Dealers have been compelled to depend on Kenya Dealer (KD) number plates, which are temporary green plates used by licensed motor vehicle dealers, garages, and importers for moving unregistered vehicles. These plates, however, are strictly for authorised movements between 6 am and 6 pm, and their misuse can result in vehicle impoundment by authorities.

The production of Kenya's number plates is reportedly carried out at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, a facility with a stated capacity of around 1,000 plates per day. However, this output, already stretched by Kenya's surging vehicle registrations, has been repeatedly hampered by the government's failure to pay the prison's commercial department on time.

### Broader Calls for Accountability Amidst National Challenges

NTSA has previously indicated that it sends SMS notifications to applicants once their plates are ready, and motorists can also check the NTSA Service Status Portal to track uncollected plates or driving licenses. However, the Motorists Association of Kenya remains dissatisfied with these partial solutions, asserting that they do not address the root cause of the crisis. "Public accountability is not optional. If money is collected for number plates, it must be used for number plates," MAK reiterated.

This ongoing crisis underscores a broader pattern of public frustration with government agencies and their handling of critical services. Just as families have demanded justice and answers in other national matters, such as the alarming reports of Kenyans being [tricked into the Russia-Ukraine War](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenyans-tricked-russia-ukraine-war-fight-die-scandal-justice), the public expects transparent and effective governance regarding the number plate debacle. The association is now vigorously pressing NTSA and the National Treasury to publicly account for the allocation of upfront plate fees and excise duty collections, and to explain why suppliers continue to remain unpaid while these vital collections persist. This issue highlights the urgent need for robust financial oversight and prompt action to restore confidence in public service delivery.
