## Court Sets March 19 for Pivotal Ruling in Case Seeking Kindiki's Removal

A three-judge bench of the High Court has scheduled March 19, 2026, as the date for a significant ruling in a petition that seeks the removal of Deputy President Kithure Kindiki from office. This politically charged **case seeking Kindiki's removal** has drawn national attention, raising profound constitutional questions regarding executive succession and the legal requirements for assuming high public office.

### The Genesis of the Case Seeking Kindiki's Removal

The petition, initiated in October 2024 by businessman Joseph Aura, not only challenges the legality of Deputy President Kindiki's swearing-in but also requests the empanelment of a five-judge bench to adjudicate the complex constitutional disputes arising from the impeachment of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua. Aura, through his legal counsel Harrison Kinyanjui, argues that the issues presented are of "exceptional public importance" and are unprecedented in Kenya's jurisprudence, necessitating a broader judicial interpretation by an expanded bench.

Central to the petitioner's argument is the contention that Deputy President Kindiki did not formally resign from his position as Interior Cabinet Secretary before taking the oath of office as Deputy President. This alleged procedural lapse, Aura maintains, contravenes constitutional provisions concerning public office and the separation of powers. While Kindiki was sworn in on November 1, 2024, following a period of legal challenges to Gachagua's removal, the petitioner insists there was no official gazettement of his cessation as Cabinet Secretary, a move deemed vital for constitutional compliance.

### Legal Maneuvers and the Call for an Expanded Bench

The current proceedings are being heard by Justices Anthony Mrima, Freda Mugambi, and Eric Ogola. Lawyer Kinyanjui has persistently urged this bench to certify the matter for an expanded panel, underscoring the novel and weighty constitutional questions at stake, particularly concerning the legal effect of executive orders on constitutional offices.

This request for an expanded bench follows a Court of Appeal judgment delivered on May 9, 2025, which dissolved a previously constituted panel that had been handling aspects of the dispute. Subsequently, Chief Justice Martha Koome directed the petitioner to pursue the application for an expanded bench before the trial court, ensuring all parties have an opportunity to respond. The Supreme Court, on January 30, 2026, had also dismissed a request by former Deputy President Gachagua to suspend ongoing High Court proceedings related to his impeachment, clarifying its jurisdiction only extends to matters before the Court of Appeal at that stage.

### The Broader Implications of the March 19 Ruling

The outcome of the March 19 ruling will not only determine whether the **case seeking Kindiki's removal** proceeds before the existing three-judge bench or is escalated to a five-judge bench but will also have significant implications for Kenya's constitutional jurisprudence and executive appointments. The legal challenge is intricately linked to the dramatic impeachment of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua in October 2024, a parliamentary process that led to President William Ruto nominating Kindiki as his replacement.

As the nation awaits this crucial judicial pronouncement, the courts continue to grapple with complex constitutional interpretations, much like how other state organs address critical national welfare issues. For instance, the recent resolution regarding [Doctors Receive Delayed SRC Salary Increments, CBA Arrears After Budget Allocation: A Critical Assessment](https://zandani.co.ke/article/doctors-receive-delayed-src-salary-increments-cba-arrears-budget-allocation) highlights the ongoing efforts to ensure fairness and adherence to agreements within the public service, demonstrating the multifaceted governance challenges Kenya navigates. The judicial determination of this **case seeking Kindiki's removal** will undoubtedly set a precedent for future successions and uphold the sanctity of constitutional procedures in Kenya's evolving democratic landscape.
