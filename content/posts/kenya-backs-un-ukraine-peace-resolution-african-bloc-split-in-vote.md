## Kenya Backs UN-Ukraine Peace Resolution: A Diplomatic Stance Amidst Continental Divides

Kenya has affirmed its commitment to global peace by voting in favour of a significant United Nations resolution aimed at achieving a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine. This decision positions Kenya with nations advocating for diplomatic solutions, even as a notable African Bloc Split in Vote emerged during the General Assembly's proceedings.

### The UN-Ukraine Peace Resolution and the African Bloc Split in Vote

The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on Tuesday, February 24, 2026, supporting efforts for peace in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The resolution passed with 107 votes in favour, 12 against, and 51 abstentions. Kenya was among the countries that voted in favour, aligning itself with a push for an immediate, full, and unconditional ceasefire and reiterating firm backing for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Notably, the United States abstained from the vote, a shift in its position compared to previous years.

The vote starkly highlighted an African Bloc Split in Vote, revealing diverse international positions on the Russia-Ukraine war. While a majority of African countries chose to abstain, Kenya joined a smaller regional group supporting the motion. Countries from the African continent that voted against the resolution included Burundi, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Mali, Niger, and Sudan. Several other African nations, including Angola, Algeria, Botswana, Ethiopia, Uganda, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Gabon, Gambia, Namibia, Senegal, Seychelles, Togo, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, notably abstained from the vote.

### Nairobi's Urgent Focus: Repatriating Kenyans from Conflict Zones

Kenya's diplomatic engagement extends beyond its UN vote, with significant national concern focused on the welfare of its citizens caught in the Ukraine conflict. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi is scheduled to visit Moscow in March 2026 to address the growing issue of Kenyan nationals involved in the war. This planned visit underscores government efforts to curb the recruitment of Kenyan youth into the conflict, driven by recent intelligence reports.

A National Intelligence Service (NIS) report tabled in Parliament revealed that over 1,000 Kenyans may have been lured into fighting roles in Ukraine, a substantial increase from previous estimates. As of February 2026, approximately 89 Kenyans are believed to be on the front line, 39 have been hospitalised due to war-related injuries, and 28 others are reported missing in action. The report also detailed methods of recruitment, indicating that individuals were often misled with promises of lucrative jobs before being sent to the front lines.

In line with these efforts, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing'Oei held separate meetings with both the Russian and Ukrainian ambassadors in Nairobi around February 20-21, 2026. These discussions focused on the safety and potential repatriation of Kenyan nationals, with PS Sing'Oei calling for unimpeded consular access and clear protocols for the return of prisoners of war and the remains of deceased citizens.

### Analysing the African Bloc Split in Vote and Kenya's Path

The pronounced African Bloc Split in Vote at the UN General Assembly reflects the complex geopolitical considerations many African nations navigate. While some countries maintain neutrality or lean towards Russia, Kenya's definitive vote in favour of the peace resolution reaffirms its adherence to principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multilateral diplomacy enshrined in the UN Charter. This stance demonstrates Kenya's consistent advocacy for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

The country's assertive diplomatic moves, including Mudavadi's upcoming visit to Moscow and PS Sing'Oei's engagements, highlight a robust commitment to protecting its citizens abroad while upholding international law. This proactive approach by Nairobi contrasts with the more varied responses seen across the continent. Beyond such critical international issues, Kenya remains deeply invested in fostering sustainable development and regional stability, as evidenced by broad initiatives such as the [AABNet and partners launch of a landmark guide on the conservation of African livestock genetic resources: Securing Africa's Agricultural Future](https://zandani.co.ke/article/aabnet-and-partners-conservation-of-african-livestock-genetic-resources-guide), a testament to the nation's comprehensive engagement on both global and continental fronts.

Kenya's position underscores a strategic foreign policy that prioritises both its national interests and its role in promoting a rules-based international order. The ongoing efforts to repatriate Kenyans from Ukraine and prevent further recruitment highlight the direct human cost of global conflicts and the imperative for focused governmental action.
