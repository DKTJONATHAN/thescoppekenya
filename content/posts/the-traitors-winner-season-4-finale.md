## The Traitors Winner Crowns Himself in Dramatic Season 4 Finale

The suspense has finally broken! "The Traitors" winner for its highly anticipated season 4 has been revealed in a truly tense and emotional finale, with Rob Rausch emerging as the sole victor, walking away with a hefty $220,800 prize pot. The strategic mastermind, a Traitor from day one, executed a series of calculated betrayals that left his fellow contestants, including close allies Maura Higgins and Eric Nam, absolutely stunned and empty-handed. The finale of "The Traitors US Season 4" premiered on February 26, 2026, on Peacock, with international viewers able to watch from February 27, 2026, depending on their time zone.

### Rob Rausch’s Masterclass in Deception Leads to The Traitors Winner Title

The season 4 finale kicked off with Mark Ballas being "murdered," setting the stage for a ruthless endgame. The final five - Rob, Eric, Maura, Johnny Weir, and Tara Lipinski - navigated a treacherous path where alliances were tested and trust was a luxury no one could afford. It quickly became clear, especially after Natalie Anderson's mistaken banishment, that Rob and Eric, with Maura firmly in Rob’s corner, had a clear trajectory to the end. Host Alan Cumming, known for his signature flair, presided over the dramatic proceedings, keeping everyone on the edge of their seats. Cumming is a prominent figure in the entertainment world, even slated to host the 2026 EE BAFTA Film Awards on February 22, 2026.

Johnny Weir was the next to go at the Roundtable, with Maura's deciding vote solidifying her unwitting role in Rob's grand scheme. The trio of Rob, Eric, and Maura then decided to "Banish Again," eliminating Tara. Little did Maura know, her fate was sealed then; the only question remaining was how many Traitors would share the prize. Rob, however, had no intention of splitting the pot, a sentiment he bluntly expressed: "Would you give $100,000 to someone you met three weeks ago? I wouldn’t."

### The Shocking Betrayal that Defined The Traitors Season 4 Finale

The most jaw-dropping moment of this "season 4 finale" came when Rob, alongside Maura, chose to banish Eric, despite Eric being a recruited Traitor. Eric, visibly hurt, tried to open Maura’s eyes, urging her to question her unwavering trust. But it was too late. Eric was eliminated, leaving Maura and Rob as the last two.

The tension reached a fever pitch as Rob finally revealed his true identity. Maura's reaction was priceless - a mix of shock, disbelief, and a touch of fury. "Oh my God, I’m so stupid," she exclaimed, feeling utterly fooled by his "pinky promise." While she initially lashed out, calling him a "snake" and declaring he’d "never going to have a girlfriend after this," she eventually conceded, "fair play though. You know what, if I was a Traitor I would have done the same. No hard feelings."

This kind of raw, unfiltered drama is exactly what keeps viewers hooked, much like the intense behind-the-scenes moments we explore in African Culture & Entertainment: The REAL Drama Behind 2025's Big Moments!

Rob, basking in his solo victory, celebrated with Alan Cumming. When asked about Maura's forgiveness, he candidly admitted, "I don’t think she’ll ever forgive me, honestly." However, Rob was clearly satisfied, having proven his strategic prowess and defied assumptions. "People just see me as a dumb, hot person, but I’ve been a Traitor from day 1 And I won. Beat everyone…" he declared. This season has undoubtedly delivered one of the most talked-about "The Traitors" winner reveals in recent memory.
