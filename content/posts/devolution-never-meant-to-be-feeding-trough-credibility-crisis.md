## Devolution Was Never Meant to Be a Feeding Trough

Kenya's devolution system, established to bring governance and services closer to its citizens, faces a significant crisis of credibility. Intended as a vehicle for equitable development and deepened democracy, the system is increasingly perceived as a conduit for unchecked spending and misuse of public funds, eroding the trust it was designed to foster.

When the constitutional architects envisioned devolution, they dreamt of a system that would address decades of centralized neglect, empowering local communities and fostering grassroots development. Since its inception in 2013, over Sh4 trillion has been disbursed to counties, a staggering sum intended to transform lives. This financial commitment was meant to manifest in tangible improvements: better roads, accessible healthcare, and thriving local economies. Yet, the reality on the ground often paints a different picture, one where the scale of allocations received does not align with visible infrastructure, health services, or economic gains in many counties.

The core challenge lies in the systematic weakening of oversight mechanisms. Public funds, meant to be protected, are instead caught in a web of political ambition, rivalry, and institutional fragility. We witness governors accusing senators of extortion, while senators, in turn, allege plunder by governors. Amidst these accusations, billions continue to flow with little accountability for misuse. This dynamic transforms crucial oversight hearings into political campaign platforms for future gubernatorial hopefuls, inevitably rendering scrutiny suspect. When Members of County Assembly (MCAs) operate without adequate resources, expertise, or independence, accountability becomes mere theatre, a performance rather than a rigorous examination of public expenditure.

### The Erosion of Trust: When Devolution Becomes a Feeding Trough

The perception that devolution has become a pipeline for unchecked spending is not merely anecdotal; it is rapidly hardening into reality. This trajectory is dangerous, undermining the very foundation of trust between citizens and their leaders. When oversight is weaponized for political battles, it loses all legitimacy, becoming a tool for vendettas rather than a safeguard for public resources. The prolonged inaction of investigative agencies on Senate recommendations further hardens impunity. Reports are meticulously written, recommendations issued, yet often, nothing tangible happens. This systemic inertia emboldens county executives, weakens assemblies, and, predictably, angers citizens who see their hard-earned taxes vanish without a trace of development.

The question then arises: what is the true score of devolution's impact? Are we witnessing genuine progress or merely a facade? One might draw a parallel to situations where outward appearances obscure underlying realities. Just as the perceived performance in sports might differ from the actual score off the green, as highlighted in "Shubhankar's 48th and Veer's 53rd in Kenya: But What's the *Real* Score Off the Green, Lads?", the official pronouncements of county development often mask the true extent of financial mismanagement and its impact on the populace. The funds allocated to counties are substantial. For instance, data from the Controller of Budget indicates that by the end of the first quarter of the 2025/2026 financial year, counties had received significant disbursements, but absorption rates and the impact on service delivery remain critical concerns.

### Restoring Integrity: Beyond the Feeding Trough Mentality

Restoring the integrity of devolution demands a concerted, multi-pronged effort. Firstly, we need credible and non-partisan oversight. This means strengthening institutions and individuals tasked with scrutiny, ensuring they are insulated from political interference and equipped to perform their duties diligently. The current system, where oversight bodies are often seen as extensions of political factions, must be reformed to foster genuine independence.

Secondly, decisive investigative action is paramount. Reports and recommendations from oversight bodies, such as the Senate, must be followed by swift and conclusive investigations by relevant agencies. The current backlog and perceived inaction only serve to perpetuate a culture of impunity. Without timely and effective prosecution of those who misuse public funds, deterrence disappears, and the cycle of corruption continues unabated.

Finally, county assemblies must be properly resourced, both financially and in terms of technical expertise. MCAs are the closest representatives of the people, yet they often lack the capacity to effectively scrutinize executive actions and budgets. Empowering them with adequate training, research capabilities, and independent operational budgets is crucial for robust local accountability. The Senate, too, has highlighted concerns about the capacity of county assemblies to perform their oversight role effectively, calling for enhanced support and training.

Devolution was never meant to be a feeding trough; it was designed as a potent vehicle for equity and development. Without credible oversight, decisive investigative action, and properly resourced county assemblies, billions will continue to flow, and public trust will continue to drain. Kenya simply cannot afford to let this vital constitutional promise fail.

Kenya's devolution system, established to bring governance and services closer to its citizens, faces a significant crisis of credibility. Intended as a vehicle for equitable development and deepened democracy, the system is increasingly perceived as a conduit for unchecked spending and misuse of public funds, eroding the trust it was designed to foster.

When the constitutional architects envisioned devolution, they dreamt of a system that would address decades of centralized neglect, empowering local communities and fostering grassroots development. Since its inception in 2013, county governments have cumulatively received over Sh4.04 trillion in equitable share and other allocations up to the 2024/25 financial year, with some reports indicating the total sum, including conditional grants, loans, and development partner funds, reaching Sh4.67 trillion since 2012/13. This staggering financial commitment was meant to manifest in tangible improvements: better roads, accessible healthcare, and thriving local economies. Yet, the reality on the ground often paints a different picture, one where the scale of allocations received does not align with visible infrastructure, health services, or economic gains in many counties.

### The Illusion of Progress: When Devolution Becomes a Feeding Trough

The notion that devolution has become a pipeline for unchecked spending is not merely anecdotal; it is rapidly hardening into reality. This trajectory is dangerous, undermining the very foundation of trust between citizens and their leaders. A stark illustration of this challenge emerged in the first quarter of the 2025/2026 financial year, when counties collectively spent a paltry 2 percent of their aggregate annual development budget, amounting to a mere Sh3.69 billion. Conversely, recurrent expenditures, including salaries and allowances, absorbed over Sh51 billion during the same period, with recurrent spending continuing to dominate county budgets and crowding out crucial capital investment.

One might question the "real score" of development when such discrepancies are evident. Like the nuanced assessment of performance beyond mere statistics, as discussed in "Shubhankar's 48th and Veer's 53rd in Kenya: But What's the *Real* Score Off the Green, Lads?", the official pronouncements of county progress often mask underlying issues of financial mismanagement. Concrete examples underscore this concern: Vihiga County reportedly spent Sh5 million on a housewarming event for the county assembly speaker, Bungoma County allocated Sh3.6 million to a Christmas tree, and Embu County allegedly redirected over Sh10 million earmarked for development projects to fund a boda boda event. Such expenditures raise serious questions about fiscal prudence and priority setting.

### The Oversight Crisis: Eroding Devolution's Credibility

The core challenge lies in the systematic weakening of oversight mechanisms. Public funds, meant to be protected, are instead caught in a web of political ambition, rivalry, and institutional fragility. We witness governors accusing senators of political witch-hunts, harassment, extortion, and intimidation. In response, the Council of Governors (CoG) has repeatedly attempted to boycott Senate audit committees, even demanding the reconstitution of the County Public Accounts Committee (CPAC). The Senate, however, steadfastly maintains that its constitutional oversight mandate is non-negotiable and essential for accountability, warning that such boycotts undermine scrutiny of county spending and threaten the future of devolution.

Further compounding the problem, the Controller of Budget (CoB) rejected budgets from 26 counties for the 2025/2026 financial year due to irregularities, including failure to link allocations to specific projects, disguising recurrent expenses as development, and missing documentation. The CoB emphasizes the critical need for budgets to be approved by July 1 for timely implementation. Despite consistent identification of unsupported expenditures, stalled projects, inflated tenders, and procurement irregularities in Auditor-General reports, enforcement remains sporadic and sanctions rare. This systemic inertia, coupled with technical and administrative deficits, particularly in marginalized counties, hinders the effective absorption of funds and service delivery, creating a significant capacity gap.

### Reclaiming the Promise: Moving Beyond a Feeding Trough
