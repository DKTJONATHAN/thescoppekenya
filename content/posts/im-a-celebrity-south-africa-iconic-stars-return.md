Right, have you heard the whispers? Honestly, if you haven't, you must be living under a rock! Because let me tell you, darling, the biggest jungle drama is about to hit our screens from South Africa, and everyone's absolutely buzzing about it.

## Is I'm A Celebrity South Africa Really Back This Spring with All Our Favourites?

Yes, absolutely! The much-anticipated second all-star series of I'm A Celebrity... South Africa is indeed making its grand return this spring, featuring a collection of memorable former contestants. It's set to bring back some of the show's most iconic faces to battle it out for the ultimate 'all-star champion' title.

## The Scoop

Well, honey, ITV has only gone and teased us with a sneak peek of "I'm A Celebrity... South Africa," confirming it's coming soon, and honestly, the suspense is killing us! Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, our beloved Geordie duo, were spotted around a campfire, with Ant getting a proper fright from what Dec called a "big cat"! (What a nightmare, eh?). And next week, there's *another* teaser on Britain's Got Talent, showing an exhausted Ant yawning. Can you even imagine the drama? This new series, filmed in September 2025, promises to be tougher than ever, with a thrilling twist: a live final where *we*, the public, get to choose the ultimate legend! Honestly, when it comes to big entertainment, you sometimes need a proper shake-up to get things buzzing, like when you hear about [Harding shuffling their coaches](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/mote-afinye-kitu-harding-coaches-shuffle-form-moto-sana) and the incredible results.

## The Evidence

Now, for the really juicy bits, mate. Speculation has been absolutely rife about which famous faces are jetting off to the South African wilderness. And let me tell you, the rumoured line-up reads like a who's who of I'm A Celeb legends! The one and only Gemma Collins, bless her heart, is reportedly returning. Remember when she famously lasted just 72 hours in the Australian jungle? She's apparently keen to prove herself, saying she'd be "like Lara Croft and Angelina Jolie rolled into one!" (A bit ambitious, perhaps, but we love her for it!). Then there's the fabulous Scarlett Moffatt, a true Queen of the Jungle from 2016. She's apparently hoping to "soak up every second" this time, knowing herself better now.

But wait, there's more! The rumour mill is absolutely churning with names like boxer David Haye, Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah, actor Craig Charles, comedian Seann Walsh, Emmerdale star Adam Thomas, singer Sinitta, Pussycat Dolls star Ashley Roberts, ex-footballer Jimmy Bullard, and even Coronation Street's Beverley Callard. And don't forget the legendary Harry Redknapp, another past winner, who's also reportedly in the mix! It's going to be absolutely wild, isn't it?

## The Verdict

Honestly, darling, this new series is shaping up to be absolutely unmissable. With a mix of past winners, dramatic quitters, and fan favourites, the South African camp is going to be an absolute powder keg of personalities. Will Gemma finally conquer her fears? Can Scarlett reclaim her crown? And who will be the ultimate legend crowned by us, the public? One thing's for sure: grab your cuppa, because this spring is going to be packed with more drama than a Nollywood blockbuster! You won't want to miss a single moment of it.
