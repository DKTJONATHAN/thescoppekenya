## Africa Is About Investment, Not Aid: A New Paradigm for Growth

Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan and African Development Bank Group President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina have unequivocally stated that Africa's future hinges on investment, not aid. Their remarks, delivered at the World Governments Summit 2026 held in Dubai from February 3-5, 2026, underscore a continent-wide push for strategic capital inflow and self-reliance over traditional reliance on foreign assistance.

### Pres. Samia and Akinwumi Adesina Advocate for Strategic Capital Inflow

President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who has served as Tanzania's head of state since March 2021, and Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, the re-elected President of the African Development Bank Group, are leading voices in advocating for a fundamental re-evaluation of how the world engages with Africa economically. Their message at the World Governments Summit, an event focused on shaping future governance, emphasized that sustainable development for African nations is best achieved through robust investment, fostering homegrown solutions and economic partnerships. This stance aligns with a broader continental strategy to harness Africa's vast potential, moving beyond aid dependency towards mutually beneficial economic collaborations.

### Kenya's Vision for Investment Attraction and Market Dynamism

Kenya is actively embodying this investment-centric philosophy, positioning itself as a pivotal gateway to markets representing a combined Gross Domestic Product of up to $75 trillion. The nation is set to host the Kenya International Investment Conference (KIICO) 2026, targeting an ambitious $2 billion in investment commitments within a single day. This proactive approach underscores a commitment to attracting substantial capital. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) has also demonstrated explosive recovery, with some Kenyan stocks registering returns as high as 517 percent. This rally is attributed to a "perfect storm" of factors, including the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) cutting interest rates, a resurgence of value investing, and consistent corporate dividends. Such market dynamism further validates the narrative that **Africa Is About Investment, Not Aid**, demonstrating the continent's capacity for significant financial returns.

The robust advertising sector, as highlighted by Erick Asuma's discussion with Sandeep Madan, CEO at The Partnership Africa, further illustrates the evolving nature of the business environment. This engagement reflects the dynamism within various industries, attracting both local and international capital and expertise.

### Beyond Aid: Sustaining Growth and Corporate Governance

The shift from aid to investment is also reflected in Kenya's domestic financial strategies. The proposed KSh 5 Trillion National Infrastructure Fund, for instance, is designed to build critical infrastructure without recourse to bonds, bank loans, or external leveraging for capital. This innovative financing mechanism exemplifies a commitment to fiscal prudence and sustainable development.

Corporate governance and strategic transitions also remain central to the investment narrative. Standard Chartered Bank Kenya recently announced the appointment of Gladys Warirah as its Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Chemutai Murgor, who will depart on May 31, 2026. This transition precedes the bank's FY 2025 results, due on March 18, following a warning that net profit for the year would fall by at least 25 percent, primarily due to pension settlement costs. Such corporate developments are closely watched by investors, who prioritize transparency and stable leadership in a market focused on long-term growth.

Further evidence of a thriving, investment-ready economy is Kenya’s formal milk intake, which surpassed one billion litres in 2025 for the first time, marking an 11.5 percent increase from 909.0 million litres in 2024. This milestone, driven by sector reforms, expanded collection networks, and stable processor payouts, signifies a durable shift in agricultural productivity and market integration. These tangible achievements reinforce the message from leaders like Pres. Samia and Akinwumi Adesina: **Africa Is About Investment, Not Aid**, offering compelling opportunities for global capital.
