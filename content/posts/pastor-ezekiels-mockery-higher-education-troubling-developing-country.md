## Pastor Ezekiel's Mockery of Higher Education: A Dangerous Undercurrent in a Developing Country

In a recent social media video, Pastor Ezekiel Odero of the New Life Prayer Centre and Church has been observed disparaging higher education and casting aspersions on university lecturers, remarks that have stirred considerable disquiet among academics and thoughtful Kenyans alike. This derision extends beyond constructive criticism, delving into troubling anti-intellectualism that carries significant risks for a nation striving for progress.

### Why Pastor Ezekiel's Mockery of Higher Education Matters

Kenya, as a developing country, relies heavily on an educated populace to navigate complex challenges and foster sustainable growth. The public statements by Pastor Ezekiel Odero, which undermine the value of university education and the expertise of lecturers, are not mere anecdotal observations; they represent a dangerous ideological stance. Such rhetoric, particularly from a figure commanding a large following, can profoundly influence public perception and the aspirations of young people.

Our national development has historically been, and continues to be, propelled by professionals trained in universities: medical doctors, engineers, teachers, policy analysts, and researchers. These individuals are crucial for regulating vital systems, designing infrastructure, and responding to national crises like pandemics and climate change. To suggest that higher education is irrelevant, or that its graduates are inherently worse off than those in the informal sector, is to ignore the foundational pillars of our societal advancement. While the dignity of artisans and craftsmen is undeniable and their contributions invaluable, presenting a false dichotomy between manual and intellectual labor is a disservice to both and to the nation's holistic progress.

### The Troubling Echoes of Anti-Intellectualism

History offers stark warnings: societies that ridicule intellectuals often stagnate. When a prominent religious leader dismisses scholarship, research, and critical inquiry, the message implicitly transmitted to the youth is that education is overrated and expertise suspect. This is a particularly perilous message in a country grappling with high unemployment, pervasive misinformation, governance deficits, climate vulnerability, and rapid technological disruption. Anti-intellectual populism can erode the very fabric of informed decision-making and innovation essential for national resilience.

Consider the irony: churches themselves frequently seek the expertise of university-trained lawyers, accountants, media experts, and architects to manage their own institutions. This practical reliance on specialized knowledge contradicts the narrative of higher education's irrelevance. The issue is not one of bruised egos among academics, but rather a fundamental concern for intellectual integrity and social responsibility.

### Higher Education and the Role of Unionism

Pastor Ezekiel's critique also extended to unionism, even taking jabs at the historic labour hymn "Solidarity Forever". This attack on organised labour is particularly revealing. Trade unionism, far from being a mere slogan, is a constitutional right in Kenya, safeguarding fair wages, safer working conditions, reasonable working hours, and grievance redress mechanisms for workers across various sectors. University lecturers in Kenya, for instance, organise through the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU). Without the advocacy of such unions, salaries could stagnate further, academic freedom might erode, and public universities could deteriorate even faster under political interference. UASU actively engages in collective bargaining and advocates for the welfare of academic staff, ensuring that the custodians of knowledge can perform their duties effectively.

It is important to acknowledge that religious figures wield immense influence, and their words from the pulpit reverberate far beyond Sunday services. They shape aspirations, influence policy perceptions, and ultimately affect how society values knowledge. To dismiss the tireless efforts of university lecturers-often underpaid and overworked individuals who teach, research, supervise, and serve on national policy committees-is to mock the very intellectual labour that builds a nation.

### A Call for Synthesis, Not Division

Some strands of prosperity preaching sometimes link wealth to divine favour and poverty to personal failure, a logic that oversimplifies complex structural realities. Kenya's graduate unemployment crisis, for example, is not the fault of lecturers but is tied to broader issues of public funding, economic structure, industrialisation levels, governance choices, and policy inconsistency. While constructive critique of university inefficiencies is valid, blanket contempt is not.

Faith and scholarship are not adversaries; historically, universities often emerged from religious contexts, with theologians, philosophers, and scientists frequently being people of faith. Kenya does not need to choose between the "hammer and the book" or the "pulpit and the podium". We require a synthesis: welders and researchers, entrepreneurs and policy analysts, pastors and professors. The hand builds, the mind designs, and the spirit guides; to demean any one aspect is to diminish the whole.

It is imperative that we engage in vigorous but responsible debate, challenging institutions where they falter but defending them when unfairly maligned. We must honour the carpenter without scorning the lecturer. For a developing country like Kenya, the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual growth is not a luxury, but a necessity for progress, perhaps even more crucial than the celebrity endorsements we sometimes chase, as explored in the piece, [Snoop Dogg's Swansea Celebrity Co-Owner Grand Welcome: But Why Not an African Football Club, Mate?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/snoop-dogg-swansea-celebrity-co-owner-african-football-gossip). Our collective future depends on valuing both faith and knowledge as companions in our shared search for truth and national flourishing.
