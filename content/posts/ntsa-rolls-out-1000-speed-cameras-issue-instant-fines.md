## NTSA Rolls Out 1,000 Speed Cameras for Enhanced Road Safety

The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) is deploying 1,000 new speed cameras nationwide as part of its Integrated Transport Management System (ITMS), a comprehensive digital initiative aimed at automating traffic enforcement and improving road safety. This strategic move facilitates the issuance of instant fines for various traffic violations.

This extensive rollout marks a pivotal moment in Kenya's approach to traffic management, shifting from manual policing to a technology-driven system. The initiative, valued at an estimated Sh42 billion in its initial phase, is being implemented through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) under the PPP Act of 2021. KCB Bank Kenya Limited and Pesa Print Limited are the private partners responsible for the design, financing, installation, and maintenance over a 21-year contract period.

### The Technology Behind the Instant Fines System

The core of this transformative project is the deployment of 1,000 advanced speed cameras. Out of these, 700 are fixed installations strategically placed on major arteries like the Thika Superhighway, Mombasa Road, and the Southern Bypass, while 300 are mobile units for flexible deployment. These cameras are designed to detect a spectrum of traffic offenses beyond just speeding, including red-light jumping and illegal maneuvers.

When a violation occurs, the system records the evidence and transmits it to a National Control Command Centre. Subsequently, an SMS notification is dispatched to the registered vehicle owner, and a fine is automatically posted to their NTSA account. This entire process is automated, eliminating the need for a traffic officer's physical presence at the point of infraction. The fines issued will be proportionate to the severity of the violation.

### Smart Driving Licenses and Demerit Points System

Beyond the deployment of 1,000 Speed Cameras, the ITMS integrates Smart Driving Licenses. These are physical cards embedded with a microprocessor chip that securely stores a driver’s history and biometric data. This upgrade is part of modernizing driver licensing, with plans to produce five million high-security polycarbonate smart cards every three years. Over 102 enrolment centers are being established across the country to support this, along with 390 enrolment kits.

A significant future development is the NTSA's plan to link a driver’s record directly to offenses detected on the road. This integration will eventually enable a demerit points system, tracking driver behavior over time rather than treating each fine as an isolated event. This progressive system aims to foster greater accountability and improve overall road discipline. Additionally, a mobile driving licence wallet is being introduced, allowing motorists to access their credentials electronically and receive compliance and enforcement notifications.

### A Broader Vision for Digital Transformation

The rollout of these initiatives follows a successful six-month pilot phase that commenced in November 2024, with data gathered confirming the efficacy for a wider implementation. Transport Cabinet Secretary Davis Chirchir affirmed that the pilot data was sufficient to proceed with the expanded rollout and procurement of additional cameras.

This drive towards automated enforcement aligns with Kenya's broader national agenda for digital transformation and road safety, anchored in Vision 2030 and the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA). Such strategic national projects underscore Kenya's commitment to leveraging technology for public benefit and modernizing its infrastructure, a vision also reflected in its growing influence on the global stage, as seen with the [Kenya Navy's recent election to lead the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium for 2030-2032](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenya-navy-elected-lead-indian-ocean-naval-symposium-2030-2032).

Public awareness remains a critical component of the ITMS's success. Drivers need clear information on how offenses are recorded, how instant fines are issued, and the processes for payment through their NTSA accounts. With this comprehensive system, Kenya is poised for a significant reduction in road fatalities and enhanced efficiency in traffic law enforcement.
