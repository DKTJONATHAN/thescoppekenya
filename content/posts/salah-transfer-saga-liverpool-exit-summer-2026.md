<h2>Salah Transfer Saga: Is Mohamed Salah Really Leaving Liverpool This Summer?</h2>
Right, so the rumour mill is absolutely churning, isn't it? It seems our Egyptian King, Mohamed Salah, is 'increasingly likely' to wave goodbye to Anfield this summer. This isn't just idle chatter either; reports are suggesting that Liverpool are keen to avoid losing one of their greatest ever players on a free transfer when his contract eventually expires in the summer of 2027.

<h3>The December Drama and Current Form</h3>
Mate, remember that absolute madness in December? Salah's outburst after a match, where he reportedly accused Liverpool of making him a scapegoat and revealed he didn't exactly have a cosy relationship with gaffer Arne Slot (who, by the way, is still very much in charge at Anfield as of today, February 28, 2026), certainly set tongues wagging. While he's back in the team now, that rift seems to have really cemented the idea of an eventual exit.

And let's be honest, his form this season hasn't been quite the usual Salah standard, has it? We're used to him tearing up the league, but he's only bagged seven goals and eight assists across 28 matches in all competitions for Liverpool this term. Is that a sign of things to come, or just a blip? You've got to wonder if this dip is playing a part in the club's thinking. It reminds you a bit of when even the most prolific strikers can hit a quiet patch, doesn't it? (Speaking of which, have you read about how Barca's frontmen have been doing lately?

<h3>Where Next for the Pharaoh?</h3>
So, if he does go, where's he off to? The whispers are getting louder for Saudi Arabia, naturally. They've been sniffing around for ages, hoping to make the 33-year-old the face of their league. Fabrizio Romano mentioned earlier this month that Saudi clubs, including Al-Ittihad, will be back in the summer transfer window. There's also talk of interest from the MLS, which could be an interesting move for a player of his calibre. Liverpool, apparently, won't want him to just walk away for nothing next year, so a summer 2026 sale makes a lot of sense if the right offer comes in. It all hinges on whether his hefty wage demands can be met, mind you.

<h3>The Replacement Plan</h3>
But who replaces a legend like Salah? That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? Reports are circulating that Liverpool are desperate to bring Michael Olise to Anfield. And guess what? Olise is currently lighting up the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. There are even claims that Liverpool are already in talks with his representatives. Now that would be a statement signing, wouldn't it? He's certainly got the flair and creativity to fill some big boots, but replacing Salah's goal output is a different kettle of fish entirely. It's going to be an interesting summer at Anfield, that's for sure.
