## Will I'm A Celeb All Stars 2026 Have a Live Final?
Yes, the 2026 series of I’m A Celebrity… South Africa will feature a live grand final broadcast directly from London. For the first time, the public will have the power to decide who is crowned the ultimate legend through a final vote, adding an exciting new element to the show.

## The Scoop
Right, so you know our beloved Ant & Dec are back, obviously, because who else could host it, honestly? This time, though, it’s not just a rerun of the first All Stars. Oh no, mate, they’re bringing in a fresh batch of "memorable campmates" to face even tougher trials in sunny South Africa. (Can you even imagine the bugs they’ll find there?). The biggest shocker? The public, that’s us, will finally get to vote for the winner in a live final! No more pre-recorded winners, thank goodness. Dec himself said it’s an "exciting addition," and Katie Rawcliffe from ITV is "blown away" by the love for the first series. It’s all happening this spring, apparently.

## The Evidence
Well, the official word from ITV confirms that "Ant & Dec will return as hosts" and the show is back in South Africa for its second all-star series. The big news is that "the public will have the power to decide who is crowned the ultimate legend 2026" in a "live grand final broadcast direct from London." And get this, The Sun, bless their cotton socks, has already dished out a list of who they reckon is heading into the wilderness! We're talking David Haye, Gemma Collins (yes, THE GC!), Seann Walsh, Harry Redknapp, Scarlett Moffatt, Adam Thomas, Mo Farah, Ashley Roberts, Sinitta, Craig Charles, Jimmy Bullard, and Beverley Callard. What a lineup, right? We’ve also heard some buzz about other exciting entertainment news, like the recent chatter surrounding [Nyashinski and Njerae's potential collaboration for MKO 2026 with Johnnie Walker](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/nyashinski-njerae-mko-2026-johnnie-walker-bundles), showing that brands are really cashing in on our favourite stars.

## The Verdict
Honestly, mate, this second run of I’m A Celebrity… South Africa sounds like it’s going to be absolutely epic. With the public finally having their say in a live final, it adds a whole new layer of drama, doesn't it? (About time, too!). The rumoured cast list is a real mix of legends and fan favourites, and if even half of them turn up, it’ll be telly gold. Those trials are "tougher than ever," according to the bosses, so prepare for some proper cringe-worthy moments and maybe a few tears. It's going to be a wild ride, and I for one, cannot wait to see who gets crowned the ultimate legend! It’s where legends are truly made, apparently.
