## Govt Leans on Local Lenders as Debt Jumps by 1.3T in 2025

Kenya's public debt surged by KSh 1.37 trillion in 2025, culminating in a KSh 12.30 trillion stock by year-end and pushing the debt ratio to 67.5% of GDP. This significant increase highlights intensified debt servicing pressures, prompting the government to increasingly pivot towards domestic financing, a strategy that continues to define its approach in 2026.

### Kenya's Debt Jumps by 1.3T in 2025: An Intensifying Burden

The National Treasury's data reveals that Kenya's public debt experienced a substantial increase of KSh 1.37 trillion over 2025, elevating the total stock to KSh 12.30 trillion by the close of the year. This expansion propelled the debt ratio to 67.5% of the Gross Domestic Product, signaling a growing fiscal burden. Concurrently, debt servicing costs escalated, with cumulative external debt service reaching KSh 376.4 billion by December 2025, representing 52.6% of the KSh 716.5 billion target for the full FY 2025/26. Commercial creditors bore the largest share of external debt service at 59.0%, followed by bilateral creditors at 24.9% and multilateral lenders at 16.1%. Domestic interest payments also remained substantial, totaling KSh 414.1 billion by December 2025, approximately 48.7% of the KSh 851.4 billion budgeted for FY 2025/26, even as Treasury bill rates had eased from their 2024 highs.

### The Strategic Shift: How Govt Leans on Local Lenders

In a deliberate strategic rebalancing, the Kenyan government is increasingly focusing on domestic financing to fund its budget, a clear indication that the Govt Leans on Local Lenders more significantly. The National Treasury has expanded its domestic debt financing plan, opting to borrow more from the local market rather than relying heavily on foreign loans. This shift is reflected in the 2026-2029 Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), which outlines plans to source 82% to 84% of gross borrowing from the domestic market. This approach aims to mitigate exposure to foreign exchange risks, particularly as the Kenyan shilling has experienced volatility.

Net domestic financing reached KSh 555.0 billion by December 2025, already accounting for 87.4% of the full-year borrowing target of KSh 634.8 billion. This left limited fiscal flexibility for the latter half of the fiscal year, placing the financing burden predominantly on institutional investors. The 2026 Budget Policy Statement projects a fiscal deficit of KSh 1.11 trillion for the FY 2026/27, with domestic financing expected to contribute KSh 1.01 trillion. The reliance on local capital markets underscores a broader effort to diversify the public debt structure and deepen the domestic debt market. However, this strategy carries the inherent risk of crowding out private sector borrowing, potentially making credit more expensive or difficult to access for businesses and households. Such fiscal management decisions are critical and often subject to public scrutiny, echoing broader concerns about governance and resource allocation, as explored in articles like [Devolution Was Never Meant to Be a Feeding Trough: A Crisis of Credibility](https://zandani.co.ke/article/devolution-never-meant-to-be-feeding-trough-credibility-crisis).

### Debt Servicing Pressures and the Role of Local Lenders

The intensifying debt servicing pressures in 2025 led to a notable rebalancing of external debt by creditor and instrument, rather than a broad re-entry into global markets. While international sovereign bonds increased by KSh 280 billion to KSh 1.13 trillion, this was partially offset by a KSh 93.5 billion reduction in commercial bank loans, reflecting refinancing and valuation effects.

As of February 24, 2026, the yield on Kenya's 10-Year Government Bond eased to 11.27%, a decrease from the previous session. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) also adjusted its base rate to 8.75% in February 2026, influencing investor appetite for government securities. In a significant move, Kenya successfully priced a USD 2.25 billion (approximately KSh 290.3 billion) dual-tranche Eurobond on February 20, 2026. This issuance, comprising notes due in 2034 and 2039, is intended to refinance near-term maturities, specifically repurchasing Eurobonds due in 2028 and 2032. This refinancing operation reflects improved market conditions and investor confidence following a recent sovereign rating upgrade.

### Navigating Future Debt Jumps: The 2026 Outlook

Kenya's public debt currently stands at approximately 70% of GDP. The 2026 MTDS projects the present value of debt-to-GDP ratio to be 65.6% for 2026. The government's strategy for managing future debt jumps involves a continued focus on liability management operations, prioritizing concessional borrowing, and maintaining a fiscal consolidation path. The successful Eurobond refinancing and the increased reliance on local lenders are key components of this proactive debt management strategy, aimed at smoothing the external debt maturity profile and reducing refinancing pressure. The government's ability to balance its financing needs with the imperative of safeguarding the private sector from excessive credit strain will be crucial for sustained economic growth in the coming years.
