Right, if you haven't heard the latest whispers from the deepest, darkest corners of the showbiz jungle, honestly, mate, where have you been? You're about to feel a serious case of FOMO because the rumour mill has been absolutely churning! We're talking big news, the kind that makes you gasp into your cuppa. I'm A Celebrity... South Africa is making a grand return in 2026, and trust us, it's set to be an absolute riot! ITV has given us a cheeky peek, and already, it’s got everyone talking.

## Is I'm A Celebrity South Africa Returning in 2026?
Yes, "I'm A Celebrity... South Africa" is indeed returning for a second all-star series in Spring 2026. Hosted by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, the show will bring back memorable past contestants to face new challenges in the South African wilderness, culminating in a live public vote for the winner.

## The Scoop
Honestly, you'd think they'd have learned their lesson the first time, wouldn't you? But no, our favourite celebs are gluttons for punishment, and we love them for it! ITV has confirmed that "I'm A Celebrity... South Africa" is officially back for 2026, and it's already causing a right stir. Ant and Dec, bless their hearts, are once again at the helm, teasing us with spooky snippets of big cats and all sorts of creepy crawlies lurking in the South African bush. The whole thing was filmed back in September 2025, apparently, so the drama is already locked and loaded, just waiting for us to feast our eyes on it this Spring. And get this, the biggest shocker? This time, there’s a LIVE final! Yes, you heard me right, the public actually gets to vote for the ultimate legend from London. (Can you even imagine the tension?)

## The Evidence
Now, for the juicy bits, because everyone wants to know *who* is brave (or daft, depending on your view!) enough to go back. The whispers, which are practically shouts at this point, suggest a cracking line-up of returning legends and, well, some who famously didn’t quite *last* their first stint. Gemma Collins, our very own GC, is strongly tipped to be making a comeback after her legendary 72-hour departure from the Australian jungle years ago. (What a redemption arc that would be, eh?) Then there's the lovely Scarlett Moffatt, a former Queen of the Jungle herself, who apparently loved it so much she’s up for round two.

The list doesn't stop there, mate! We're talking boxing champ David Haye, Olympic hero Sir Mo Farah, the brilliant actor Craig Charles, comedian Seann Walsh, *Emmerdale*'s Adam Thomas, singer Sinitta, Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, football legend Jimmy Bullard, and even *Corrie*'s Beverley Callard. And get this, even Harry Redknapp, a previous king of the jungle, is rumoured to be heading back. Honestly, the thought of all those big personalities clashing in the wilderness! Sometimes, mate, the context of a celebrity's past actions is everything, much like how important context is even for AI, if you catch my drift. [AI Ni Ndogo, Context Ndiyo Mdosi wa Ukweli!](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/ai-ndogo-context-ndiyo-mdosi-ukweli) It's going to be absolute chaos, and we wouldn't have it any other way. While ITV is playing coy, saying these names are "just speculation," every major outlet has been reporting these stars are a dead cert!

## The Verdict
So, there you have it. "I'm A Celebrity... South Africa" is gearing up to be the most dramatic, hilarious, and utterly unmissable TV event of the Spring. With Ant and Dec back to torment our favourite stars, and a line-up that promises both triumphs and, let's be honest, probably a few more early exits (Gemma, we're looking at you!), it's going to be proper telly. Will past winners retain their crown? Will the quitters finally conquer their fears? One thing's for sure: our evenings are about to get a whole lot more exciting. Better clear your schedule, because this is one jungle adventure you won’t want to miss a single second of!
