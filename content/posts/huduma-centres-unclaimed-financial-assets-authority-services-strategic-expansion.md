## Enhancing Access to Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority Services

The integration of Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority (UFAA) services into Huduma Centres nationwide represents a pivotal moment in the government's commitment to citizen-centric service delivery. This strategic move, officially launched on Wednesday, February 25, 2026, aims to simplify the process for Kenyans to reclaim dormant financial assets.

The Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority, established under the Unclaimed Financial Assets Act, 2011, serves as a trustee for the Unclaimed Assets Trust Fund. Its core mandate involves receiving, safeguarding, and ultimately reuniting abandoned assets-such as dormant bank accounts, uncollected dividends, and insurance policies-with their rightful owners. The partnership with Huduma Kenya allows citizens to make claims for their unclaimed cash and other financial assets free of charge at any of the 59 Huduma Centres across the country. This initiative is expected to significantly enhance the reunification process, leveraging Huduma Centres' extensive reach to connect with individuals across various economic segments.

### The Mandate Behind Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority Services

The Unclaimed Financial Assets Act, 2011, provides the legislative framework for the UFAA's operations, ensuring proper management and reporting of unclaimed financial assets. This legal foundation is crucial for protecting the financial interests of individuals and fostering trust within Kenya's financial system by safeguarding forgotten wealth. The Authority enforces reporting requirements for institutions holding these assets and facilitates the claims process, a critical function in returning billions of shillings to their legitimate owners. Notably, a proposed amendment bill in May 2024, the Unclaimed Financial Assets (Amendment) Bill, 2024, seeks to empower claimants to designate recipients for their recovered funds, an important legislative evolution to enhance claimant flexibility.

## Broader Implications of Huduma Centres Expansion

The expansion of services at Huduma Centres extends beyond the Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority services, signalling a broader governmental strategy to decentralise and streamline public interactions. These centres, first introduced in 2013, have become crucial one-stop shops for a multitude of government services, including national ID and passport processing, birth certificate applications, business permits, and driving licences. This approach to public service delivery aligns with modern efficiency models seen in various sectors, where strategic partnerships and technology integration drive improved performance. For instance, the collaboration between Xledger and Bristol Bears Women in sports demonstrates how technological solutions can streamline complex operations for optimal outcomes.

### Integrating Nairobi County and Judiciary Services at Huduma Centres

In a parallel development underscoring the government's push for enhanced accessibility, Nairobi County introduced service desks at Eastleigh, Kibra, and Makadara Huduma Centres on February 17, 2026. This allows residents to access county-specific services such as land rate processing, county parking fee payments, and business permit applications and renewals, making interactions with local government more convenient. A Service Level Agreement was formalised around February 20, 2026, to deepen this collaboration.

Furthermore, selected Huduma Centres in Nairobi, including GPO, City Square, Makadara, and Kibra, now offer Judiciary services. These include e-filing support, payment of fines, and case status inquiries, a significant step towards demystifying the judicial process and making it more accessible to the public. These comprehensive integrations underscore a robust policy direction aimed at fostering a more efficient and transparent government-citizen interface across Kenya. Kenyans are encouraged to utilise the official communication channels of Huduma Centre, including social media or the helpline at 1919, for assistance or clarification.
