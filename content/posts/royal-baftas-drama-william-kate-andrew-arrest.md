Right, gather round, because honestly, I’ve had one of those weeks where you just have to put on your best smile even when you feel like screaming into a cushion. Like last Tuesday, when my neighbour’s cat decided my pristine petunias were actually a litter tray, and I still had to wave sweetly at her over the fence. (Can you even imagine?). Well, multiply that by a thousand, add a dash of global scrutiny, and you might just get a hint of what William and Kate were going through at the BAFTAs this Sunday!

## Did William and Kate Actually Address the Andrew Arrest at the BAFTAs?

No, Prince William and Princess Catherine didn't directly comment on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's recent arrest at the BAFTAs. Their joint appearance, just days after the scandal, was widely seen as a deliberate show of unity amidst the unfolding royal drama.

The Scoop

Honestly, the air in London's Royal Festival Hall must have been absolutely thick with unspoken drama! Just days after William’s uncle, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (yes, *that* Andrew), was nicked from his Sandringham home on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the future King and Queen stepped out. Talk about putting on a brave face, eh? They were all smiles, apparently, as they were ushered in, with William, our dear Prince, being the President of the awards, no less! You’d think they’d be hiding under a duvet, but no, duty calls!

The Evidence

Well, the public couldn't help but notice the timing, could they? Their first major engagement since the royal arrest, and they were putting on a proper united front. Fashion experts were even having a chinwag about their carefully planned outfits - Kate, ever the thrifty one, rewearing a gorgeous pink-and-cream Gucci gown from 2019! Paired with a burgundy velvet Prada clutch, she looked sensational. And William, bless him, wore a matching maroon velvet blazer. Coordinated outfits mean unity, don't they? That's what the experts say, anyway.

It wasn't all serious royal business, mind. Kate admitted she'd watched 'Hamnet' the night before and was left in "floods of tears" - "ended up with very puffy eyes," she joked. What a nightmare before a red-carpet event! William, though, hadn't seen it, saying he "needed to be in quite a calm state and I am not at the moment." Bit telling, that, wouldn't you say?

And speaking of big dramas, remember that whole kerfuffle with [Rashford's Barca Drama: Injury Comeback, Buyout Clause Chaos, and Man U's Carrick Crossroads](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/rashford-barca-drama-injury-buyout-carrick-man-u)? Talk about a rollercoaster, eh?

Anyway, the BAFTAs themselves were quite the show! Kylie Jenner, the American businesswoman, secretly snuck in to support her boyfriend, Timothée Chalamet, who was nominated for 'Marty Supreme'. How very discreet of her! Wunmi Mosaku made history, bagging Best Supporting Actress for 'Sinners', becoming the first Black British winner in that category. And 'One Battle After Another' led the nominations with 14 nods. So, plenty of glitz to distract from the royal rumblings, even if just for an evening.

The Verdict

Honestly, you've got to hand it to William and Kate. Amidst all that family chaos, they turned up, smiled for the cameras, and carried on. It's almost like they're saying, "We're here, we're united, and we're not letting a little (or rather, huge) family scandal ruin our evening!" The monarchy, mate, it's never dull, is it? What a performance!
