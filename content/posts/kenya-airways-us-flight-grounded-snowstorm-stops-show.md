Well, if you thought *your* weekend plans were ruined, spare a thought for those caught in Kenya Airways' latest drama - it's a real cliffhanger, isn't it? Like a grand old telenovela episode where everyone's left hanging, wondering what on earth will happen next! Honestly, the absolute nerve of Mother Nature, causing such a fuss.

## What's the latest on Kenya Airways' cancelled flights?

Kenya Airways has cancelled two flights, KQ002 and KQ003, on its Nairobi-New York route. This was due to a severe blizzard warning and heavy snowfall forcing John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to suspend operations on Sunday, February 22, 2026, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded on both sides of the Atlantic.

Right, so the scoop is, our very own national carrier, Kenya Airways, had to pull the plug on their Nairobi-New York flights. Can you even imagine? Flight KQ002, which was supposed to jet off from Nairobi on Sunday, February 22, got grounded, and its return leg, KQ003 from New York on Monday, February 23, met the same frosty fate. What a nightmare for anyone hoping for a bit of Big Apple glamour or a quick trip home!

The airline, bless 'em, put out a statement saying it was all down to a "blizzard warning and severe weather conditions" in the good old US of A, with "heavy snowfall in New York" causing absolute mayhem at JFK. Apparently, airport authorities just threw their hands up and suspended all flights for certain periods. Honestly, the weather really does have a sense of humour, doesn't it?

Now, this Nairobi-New York route is a big deal, mate. It's one of the longest non-stop air corridors in the world, covering a whopping 7,351 miles and taking about 15 hours. Kenya Airways is the only one doing non-stop flights between East Africa and New York. Since 2018, they've shifted over 300,000 passengers and 6,000 tonnes of cargo! That's a lot of folks and a lot of luggage, innit?

And get this, it's not the first time KQ has had a spot of bother recently. Just a few weeks ago, they had to ground flights to Rwanda and Mauritius because of "poor visibility" at Kigali International. Honestly, it's one thing after another!

Kenya Airways has said they're terribly sorry for the inconvenience (as you'd expect!) and are hoping to get KQ002 back in the air on Tuesday, February 24, and KQ003 on Wednesday, February 25. But only if the weather plays nice and the airport bigwigs give the all-clear, of course. Passengers have been told to keep an eye on the airline's website or app, or give customer service a ring. With all this travel drama, one almost forgets about other big news, like when [Ida Odinga's KSh 500M Net Worth was Revealed During Emotional UNEP Vetting](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/ida-odinga-net-worth-unep-vetting-raila-tribute). What a contrast, eh? From blizzards to bank balances!

So, there you have it. Another day, another dramatic twist in the world of travel. Fingers crossed for all those stranded travellers. Let's hope those planes get flying soon, before everyone starts building snowmen in the departure lounge!
