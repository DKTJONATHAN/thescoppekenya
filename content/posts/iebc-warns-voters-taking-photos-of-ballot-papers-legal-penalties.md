## IEBC Warns Voters: Upholding Ballot Secrecy in the Digital Age

The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has reiterated that photographing ballot papers at polling stations is prohibited, constituting an electoral offense under Kenyan law. This measure aims to safeguard the integrity of the vote and prevent undue influence, coercion, and vote-buying, with violations leading to legal penalties.

### The Digital Threat to Ballot Secrecy and Legal Penalties

As Kenya navigates a highly digitized landscape, the IEBC is intensifying its efforts to protect the sanctity of the vote. Ahead of four by-elections scheduled for today, Thursday, February 26, 2026, the commission has issued a stern reminder that taking photos of ballot papers is a direct breach of ballot secrecy and the sovereignty of the vote. This practice violates specific provisions of the Constitution of Kenya, notably Articles 38(3)(b) and 81(e).

The IEBC emphasizes that "Any act that compromises this secrecy, including photographing or recording a marked ballot paper, undermines the integrity of the electoral process, exposes voters to undue influence, coercion, and vote-buying, and constitutes an electoral offence." This directive arrives in the wake of widespread sharing of ballot paper photos on social media during the by-elections held on November 27, 2025. Election observers from the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) corroborated claims of voter buying during last year's by-elections, noting instances in Mbeere North constituency where voters were openly encouraged to photograph marked ballots as a tactic to enforce vote-buying.

### Administrative Measures to Prevent Taking Photos of Ballot Papers

To counter these challenges, the IEBC has pledged to implement unspecified "administrative control measures" to prevent a recurrence at polling booths. These measures include requiring voters to surrender their mobile phones to IEBC officials before entering voting booths. Such steps are critical given Kenya's high mobile penetration rate, which reached 149 percent by late 2025, and a smartphone penetration rate standing at 80.8 percent, making ballot photography a growing tactic for voter-buying.

The commission has made it clear that individuals found in violation of ballot secrecy will face stringent legal penalties. However, it is important to note that photography of duty-filled and certified result forms is permissible once the declaration of results has been successfully completed.

As digital platforms continue to reshape societal interactions, the responsibility to uphold democratic principles falls on every citizen. Just as Murugi Munyi reminds us that the "Power to Change Your Life - It's All On You, Darling!", so too does the integrity of our electoral process largely depend on individual adherence to established regulations.
