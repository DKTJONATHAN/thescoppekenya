## Siaya County Officer Suspended: Unpacking the Allegations Against Governor Orengo

A senior Siaya County official, Richard Omondi Odhiambo, has been suspended for alleged defamatory remarks against Governor James Orengo, sparking debate on public service conduct and political expression. The disciplinary action follows comments made at a recent political rally, which the county government deemed "unsavoury, derogatory, insulting and disrespectful."

The County Government of Siaya moved swiftly to suspend Richard Omondi Odhiambo, known popularly as Makamu, from his role as County Information Management Officer. The suspension, formalised in a letter dated February 25, follows a highly publicised incident at an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) rally held on Saturday, February 21, in Kisumu County. During the "Linda Mwananchi" rally, Odhiambo allegedly launched a scathing critique of Governor Orengo, directly challenging his leadership and conduct.

### The Contentious Defamatory Remarks Against Governor Orengo

Richard Omondi Odhiambo's remarks reportedly accused Governor Orengo of undermining the ODM party and diminishing its political standing within Ugenya. He claimed to have previously warned the Governor about these actions, asserting that his advice was ignored. "I have told him time and again that he is destroying our votes in Ugenya, yet he does not listen," Makamu stated publicly. Furthermore, Odhiambo questioned Governor Orengo's loyalty to the ODM party and accused him of failing to consult senior party officials. In a particularly contentious accusation that rapidly circulated on social media, Odhiambo allegedly suggested that "what is troubling Governor Orengo is too much chang'aa". These pronouncements generated widespread discussion, eliciting both support and condemnation across various social media platforms.

### Siaya County Officer Suspended: Implications for Public Service Ethics

The Siaya County government has categorised Odhiambo's actions as gross misconduct and insubordination, citing violations of the Public Officer Ethics Act and the Public Service Human Resource Policies and Procedures Manual. The suspension, effective immediately, mandates Odhiambo to surrender all county government property and submit a written explanation within seven days. This directive aims to provide cause why further disciplinary action, potentially including dismissal, should not be initiated. This incident underscores the critical need for adherence to public service ethics, a principle that echoes discussions across various sectors regarding accountability and integrity, much like the conversations surrounding transparency in events such as the [Magical Kenya Open: Junior Players 'Inspired,' But Where's the Real Dough, Darlings?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/magical-kenya-open-junior-players-inspiration-cash-gossip).

### Broader Ramifications for Governance and Governor Orengo's Leadership

The suspension of a senior official for publicly criticising a sitting governor highlights the delicate balance between freedom of expression and the obligations of public service. It also brings into sharp focus the internal dynamics within political parties and county administrations. For Governor Orengo, this incident presents a challenge to his authority and leadership, particularly given the public nature of the allegations. The accusations touch upon core aspects of governance and party loyalty, which are significant in Kenya's political landscape.

This situation is not the first instance where defamation has played a role in high-profile Kenyan politics. Governor James Orengo himself was previously ordered to pay Ksh1 million in damages after a court found him liable for defaming the mother of former Kisii Governor James Ongwae during a political rally in 2023. This historical context illustrates the legal precedents and financial consequences associated with defamatory statements by political figures and public servants.

As the seven-day period for Richard Omondi Odhiambo's response commences, the political and administrative implications for Siaya County will continue to unfold. The outcome of this disciplinary process will undoubtedly set a precedent for public officers engaging in political commentary, further defining the boundaries of speech within county governance.
