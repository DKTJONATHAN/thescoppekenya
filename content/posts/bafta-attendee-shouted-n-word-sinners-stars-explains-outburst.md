## BAFTA Attendee Shouted N-Word: The Full Story Behind the Outburst
Tourette syndrome advocate John Davidson has offered a comprehensive explanation for his involuntary use of offensive language, including the N-word, during the recent British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards ceremony. The incident, which occurred as "Sinners" stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented an award, has ignited crucial conversations about disability awareness and public understanding.

The highly anticipated 2026 BAFTA Film Awards, held on Sunday, February 22, 2026, saw an unexpected turn of events when John Davidson, a prominent Tourette syndrome advocate, experienced severe verbal tics during the ceremony. Davidson, whose life story inspired the BAFTA-winning film *I Swear*, was present to support the movie and its star, Robert Aramayo, who clinched both the Best Leading Actor and the Rising Star Award for his portrayal of Davidson. The most controversial moment unfolded when Davidson involuntarily shouted the N-word as Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo, co-stars of the film *Sinners*, were on stage presenting the Best Visual Effects award.

### John Davidson Explains Outburst and Tourette's Impact
In an interview published Tuesday, February 24, 2026, Davidson shared his profound distress over the impact of his tics, stating, "I can't begin to explain how upset and distraught I have been as the impact from Sunday sinks in." He emphasized that his tics are "an involuntary neurological misfire" and "have absolutely nothing to do with what I think, feel, or believe." Davidson further clarified that his tics are not intentional or a reflection of his values, but rather an uncontrollable symptom of his condition. He explained that suppressing tics can lead to intense pressure, often resulting in a "tic attack" where words "burst out... like a gunshot." For Davidson, his tics are "so aggressive that I have no idea when they are coming or what they will be," leaving him with almost no ability to suppress them, especially under stressful conditions.

### The BAFTA Response and Apologies for the Shouted N-Word
BAFTAs host Alan Cumming promptly addressed the audience during the ceremony, apologizing for Davidson's remarks and explaining that Tourette syndrome is a disability, and the tics are involuntary. The awards organization later issued a statement acknowledging the "very offensive language that carries incomparable trauma and pain for so many," and apologized to all affected. They noted that measures were taken to inform attendees about Davidson's presence and his tics, including an announcement before the ceremony began. Delroy Lindo expressed his hope that "someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards," highlighting the immediate impact on the presenters.

### Beyond the Racial Slur: Understanding Davidson's Condition
Davidson clarified that the N-word was one of "perhaps 10 different offensive words" he uttered that evening, contrary to some initial reports focusing solely on the racial slur. He stressed that what people hear him shouting is "literally the last thing in the world I believe; it is the opposite of what I believe." The advocate, who rose to prominence at 16 as the subject of the BBC TV documentary *John's Not Mad*, questioned the wisdom of placing a microphone in front of him, "knowing I would tic." This incident underscores the ongoing need for greater understanding and empathy towards individuals living with Tourette syndrome.
