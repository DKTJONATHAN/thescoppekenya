## KNEC to KNEAC: A Welcome Reform with Caution in Kenya's Education System

The proposed shift from the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) to the Kenya National Education Assessment Council (KNEAC) marks a significant evolution in Kenya’s educational assessment philosophy, moving towards a more holistic, competency-based approach. This transition, while a welcome reform with caution, necessitates meticulous planning and equitable resource distribution to ensure no region is disadvantaged.

Kenya's education system stands at a profound inflection point. For generations, the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) has been the undisputed arbiter of academic achievement, its high-stakes, end-of-cycle examinations defining pathways and shaping destinies within the 8-4-4 system. Yet, as the nation embraces the Competency-Based Education (CBE) framework, the limitations of an assessment model primarily designed for summative evaluation have become strikingly apparent. The Kenya National Education Assessment Council Bill, 2025, approved by the Cabinet and forwarded to Parliament as of February 2026, aims to fundamentally reorient this paradigm, shifting from a narrow examinations' council to a broader assessments' council. This is undeniably a necessary and **welcome reform with caution**.

### Understanding the KNEC to KNEAC Transition

The essence of the **KNEC to KNEAC** transformation lies in its conceptual shift: integrating formative, school-based, sample-based, and national assessments into a cohesive framework. This approach prioritises continuous feedback, supports learner development over mere ranking, and aligns assessment more closely with pedagogical goals. It is a progressive move, mirroring global trends that seek to equip learners with practical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities essential for a rapidly evolving world. KNEC, even in February 2026, continues to administer national examinations like KPSEA, KJSEA, and KCSE, while also preparing for the rollout of Grade 10 school-based assessments under CBE, indicating an ongoing transitional phase. This duality underscores the complexity of moving away from a deeply ingrained system.

However, the path to this new era is fraught with challenges. The implementation of CBE itself has faced hurdles, including inadequate teacher training, insufficient resources, and infrastructure gaps. Will the new KNEAC framework inherit these systemic issues, or will it be empowered to address them head-on?

### The Imperative for Caution in Education Reform

While the philosophical underpinnings of this shift are sound, the practicalities demand a **reform with caution**. The disparities in readiness across Kenya's diverse regions, particularly in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties, cannot be overstated. These areas frequently contend with inadequate infrastructure, persistent teacher shortages, limited digital connectivity, and constrained financial resources. Continuous and competency-based assessment systems, by their very nature, require well-trained educators, robust moderation systems, sophisticated data management capabilities, and strong oversight mechanisms. These are not elements that can be conjured overnight; they must be deliberately developed and sustained.

Ignoring these regional discrepancies risks exacerbating existing inequities, turning a well-intentioned reform into another barrier for already marginalised communities. The national government, county administrations, and development partners must forge a coordinated strategy, making targeted investments in teacher professional development, digital infrastructure, and institutional strengthening where the gaps are most pronounced. This calls for proactive involvement from county governments to align their planning and budgeting frameworks, and differentiated national support.

### Ensuring Equity: A Core Principle for this Welcome Reform

Equity must remain the bedrock principle guiding this **welcome reform**. Just as efforts are made to ensure broader participation and recognition in other spheres, such as the shortlisting of "Get Out Get Active" for a Sport Industry Award - a commendable acknowledgement of grassroots efforts - so too must our education system ensure every child, regardless of their geographical location, has an equal opportunity to thrive under the new assessment framework.

The transition from KNEC to KNEAC is far more than an administrative rebranding; it signifies a profound systemic reorientation of assessment as a catalyst for learning, rather than merely a final judgment. It is a moment that demands not just vision, but also meticulous execution, empathetic understanding of regional realities, and an unwavering commitment to equity. Only then can this pivotal moment truly usher in an era where every Kenyan learner is prepared for the future, not just those in well-resourced areas. The question is not whether the reform is needed, but whether we possess the collective will to implement it with the necessary foresight and fairness.
