## Odemba Tips Harambee Starlets for WAFCON Glory

Harambee Starlets head coach Beldine Odemba has expressed strong confidence in her squad's ability to make a significant impact at the upcoming 2026 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) in Morocco, specifically tipping them to break their historical knockout stage duck. The tournament, scheduled from March 17 to April 3, 2026, marks Kenya's return to the continental stage after a decade.

## Harambee Starlets Break WAFCON Knockout Duck: The Road Ahead

The Harambee Starlets are currently in an intensive preparation phase for WAFCON 2026, with Coach Beldine Odemba meticulously fine-tuning the squad for the continental showpiece. Kenya has been drawn into a challenging Group A, where they will face tournament hosts Morocco, alongside formidable opponents Senegal and Algeria. The Starlets' opening match is set for March 17 against Morocco.

### Coach Odemba's Strategic Preparations

Coach Odemba's strategic approach includes high-profile international friendly matches and an overseas training camp to sharpen the team's competitive edge. The team is set to depart on Saturday, February 28, 2026, for Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where they will engage in two crucial friendlies against Benin on March 2 and Ivory Coast on March 4. Following these fixtures, the squad will proceed to Miramas, France, for a residential training camp that will run until March 15, before making their way to Morocco for the tournament. This comprehensive build-up is a clear indication of the team's ambition to perform exceptionally. The provisional squad, blending experienced players like Jentrix Shikangwa and Lorna Nyarinda with emerging talents, underscores Odemba's vision for both immediate success and long-term growth.

### The Quest to Break the WAFCON Knockout Duck

Kenya's qualification for WAFCON 2026 is a significant achievement, marking their return to the tournament after their debut in 2016. The journey included a memorable 4-1 aggregate victory over The Gambia in October 2025, which sealed their spot. A pivotal moment in their qualification campaign was the "Sousse Miracle" in February 2025, where goalkeeper Lilian Awuor's heroic two penalty saves secured a 1-0 aggregate win against Tunisia, providing a crucial psychological boost. This resilience and determination are what Odemba hopes will enable the Harambee Starlets to finally break their WAFCON knockout duck and advance beyond the group stages. The expansion of the tournament to 16 teams also presents more opportunities for competitive play.

### Broader Kenyan Football Aspirations

The excitement surrounding the Harambee Starlets' WAFCON campaign is palpable across the nation, reflecting a growing enthusiasm for Kenyan football on the international stage. This momentum is also evident with the men's national team, as detailed in the recent report on [FIFA Series 2026 Explained: Harambee Stars Matches Confirmed for Global Showcase](https://zandani.co.ke/article/fifa-series-2026-explained-harambee-stars-matches). Such international engagements are crucial for the development and exposure of Kenyan talent.

### Challenges and the Call for Support

Despite the rigorous preparations and high hopes, challenges remain. Star forward Mwanahalima "Dogo" Adam has voiced concerns regarding the level of official backing, making a plea for more visible government support to motivate the players ahead of their departure for North Africa. This call for recognition highlights the importance of comprehensive support for national teams as they represent Kenya on the global stage. The Starlets are balancing tactical drills with a public appeal for the encouragement their hard work merits.
