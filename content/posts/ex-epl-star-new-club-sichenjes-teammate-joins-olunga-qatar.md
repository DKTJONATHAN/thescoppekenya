## Ex-EPL Star Michail Antonio Finds New Club in Qatar

Michail Antonio, the seasoned former West Ham United striker, has officially found a new club, Al-Sailiya, in Qatar, marking an end to a challenging 15-month period. This significant move sees the 35-year-old join fellow Kenyan international Michael Olunga, after a prospective deal to become Collins Sichenje's teammate at Charlton Athletic ultimately did not materialise.

### Antonio's Journey to a New Club

The past 15 months have been a true test of resilience for Michail Antonio, West Ham United's eighth all-time leading scorer with an impressive 83 goals. His career took an unexpected turn following a serious car accident in December 2024, which sidelined him from the Hammers' first team. Since the incident, Antonio saw limited action, playing just five games - three for Jamaica and two for West Ham U-21 - accumulating only 169 minutes on the pitch. His decade-long tenure with the London club concluded with his departure, having not featured in either the youth or senior squads this season.

### Near Miss with Sichenje, Link-Up with Olunga in Qatar

Reports indicate Antonio diligently maintained his fitness by training with Charlton Athletic, and a move to the Addicks, which would have made him Collins Sichenje's teammate, was reportedly close to fruition. However, the two parties ultimately failed to reach an agreement. The experienced striker has now secured a new club, signing a short-term deal with Qatari Stars League side Al-Sailiya. This exciting development means Antonio will now be playing alongside another Harambee Stars captain, Michael Olunga, in the vibrant Qatar Stars League. This pursuit of fresh challenges and new environments for players is a continuous thread in global football, echoing broader discussions on development, such as the ongoing conversations around [India Football Reforms: Is the 'Sleeping Giant' Finally Stirring, Mate?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/india-football-reforms-sleeping-giant-stirring).

### Impact on Al-Sailiya and Jamaica's World Cup Hopes

Antonio is set for a two-month stint with his new team as the Qatar Stars League enters its critical final stage, with only six rounds remaining. Al-Sailiya currently occupies ninth position in the league table, tied with two other teams hovering perilously close to the relegation zone. His veteran experience and goal-scoring prowess will undoubtedly be a valuable asset for the Doha side in their crucial battle for survival. Beyond his club commitments, this move provides Antonio with a vital opportunity to maintain peak fitness ahead of Jamaica's significant appearance in the 2026 FIFA World Cup inter-confederation play-offs. The Reggae Boyz are scheduled to face New Caledonia on March 26, and, in the event of a victory, will play a decisive duel against DR Congo five days later on March 31. This intense period highlights Antonio's unwavering commitment to both his club and national team at a pivotal moment in his distinguished career.
