## IEBC Opens Temporary Jobs for Enhanced Voter Registration
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has initiated a recruitment drive for 12,520 temporary positions to facilitate a 30-day Enhanced Continuous Voter Registration (ECVR) exercise across Kenya at the ward level. This strategic move aims to expand the national voter database ahead of future electoral processes. Successful applicants for these crucial roles will receive an estimated daily remuneration of Ksh2,000 per day.

### Understanding the Remuneration for IEBC Temporary Jobs
The announcement by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Wednesday, February 25, confirmed that individuals selected for these temporary roles would earn approximately Ksh2,000 per day for the duration of the assignment. This daily pay structure underscores the short-term, intensive nature of the voter registration drive. The remuneration for government-related temporary roles often reflects the specific tasks and duration, much like recent discussions around salary increases for permanent county government employees, such as those announced by the Turkana and Homa Bay County Governments. This financial commitment highlights the IEBC's operational budgeting to ensure the successful execution of the voter registration mandate.

### Details of the IEBC Temporary Jobs and Application Process
The 12,520 temporary positions are categorised into Voter Registration Assistants (1,450 vacancies), Voter Registration Clerks (10,780 vacancies), and ICT Clerks (290 vacancies). These roles are critical for the ward-level registration initiative, which seeks to decentralise voter registration services and make them more accessible to eligible Kenyans.

Applicants for these IEBC temporary jobs must be Kenyan citizens aged 19 years and above, holding a minimum Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) grade of C- (minus) or its equivalent. Essential qualifications include computer literacy and basic ICT expertise. For certain roles, a diploma in ICT, statistics, education, business administration, or a related field will be considered an added advantage.

Voter Registration Assistants will be tasked with supervising clerks, coordinating equipment movement schedules, compiling registration statistics, and ensuring wards meet their voter registration targets. Voter Registration Clerks will primarily engage directly with the public, assisting individuals in registering as voters. ICT Clerks are expected to operate and troubleshoot biometric registration equipment, including KIEMS kits and associated hardware and software systems.

The application window for these temporary election jobs opened on February 25, 2026, and will close at midnight on March 4, 2026. Interested candidates are required to submit their applications online via the official IEBC portal's jobs section. Shortlisted candidates will undergo mandatory training and take an oath of secrecy before deployment to their respective wards. This rigorous process ensures that personnel are adequately prepared and committed to maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

### The Broader Political Impact of the Enhanced Voter Registration Exercise
This Enhanced Continuous Voter Registration exercise is a significant undertaking by the IEBC, aimed at strengthening the nation's democratic foundation by expanding the voter register. The commission's objective is to capture an estimated 6.3 million additional voters, building on the current 22.1 million, in anticipation of future elections. By taking registration services closer to the citizens at the ward level, the IEBC seeks to overcome previous challenges of limited access, particularly for young eligible voters in far-flung areas. The allocation of a substantial budget of Sh8 billion for this drive, alongside funds for voter education and KIEMS kit maintenance, underscores the commission's commitment to a robust and inclusive electoral process. This strategic recruitment of personnel to manage the process, coupled with the daily pay, is a critical component of ensuring logistical efficiency and public participation in Kenya's democratic journey.
