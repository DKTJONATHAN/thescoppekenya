## Justice Isaac Lenaola Elected President of Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone

Supreme Court Judge Isaac Lenaola has been elected President of the Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone (RSCSL) for a renewable two-year term, marking a significant elevation for Kenyan representation in global judicial institutions. This appointment underscores Kenya's growing influence and expertise within the international legal framework.

The election of Justice Lenaola, who previously served as the Court’s Vice President, occurred during a two-day plenary session held at The Hague in the Netherlands, with the announcement made on February 27, 2026. His new leadership role places a Kenyan jurist at the helm of an institution critical to upholding justice and managing the enduring legal obligations stemming from Sierra Leone's civil war.

### Sustained Judicial Excellence: Justice Isaac Lenaola's Extensive Career

Justice Lenaola's esteemed career demonstrates a profound commitment to justice, both nationally and internationally. He joined Kenya's Judiciary in 2003 and was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2016. His tenure with the RSCSL spans 12 years, having served as a judge since 2013. Before his elevation to the Supreme Court, Justice Lenaola presided over the Constitutional and Human Rights Division of the High Court in Milimani, Nairobi. His regional experience includes serving as a Judge and Deputy Principal Judge of the East African Court of Justice between 2011 and 2018.

His election as President is a testament to his extensive experience and scholarly contributions to law. This international recognition for a Kenyan judge occurs as the nation continues to navigate its own complex policy discussions, such as the ongoing considerations around fiscal adjustments. For instance, recent reports have highlighted the [Treasury Tax Reduction Conditions Set for PAYE, VAT, and Income Tax Reduction](https://zandani.co.ke/article/treasury-tax-reduction-conditions-paye-vat-income-tax-reduction), demonstrating a dynamic period across various sectors in Kenya.

### New Leadership for the Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone

During the same plenary session that saw Justice Isaac Lenaola elected President, the judges also elected other key officials. Prominent British Judge Justice Andrew Hatton was chosen as Vice President, while Justice Tonia Barnett from Sierra Leone was appointed as Staff Appeals Judge. Justice Hatton has been a judge of the RSCSL since 2013, bringing extensive experience from his law practice in the United Kingdom and his previous role as an International Criminal Judge in the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo. Justice Barnett joined the RSCSL in 2021, having served in Sierra Leone’s judiciary in various capacities, including as a Magistrate and a Judge of the Court of Appeal.

The plenary meeting also addressed critical institutional matters. Discussions included proposed rule amendments, a draft stocktaking report, funding issues, and the Court’s 12th Annual Report, which covers activities for the year 2025.

### The Enduring Mandate of the Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone

The Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone plays a crucial role in international justice, continuing the legal responsibilities of the former Special Court for Sierra Leone, whose mandate concluded in December 2013. Its work encompasses supervising prison sentences, safeguarding witnesses, preserving court archives, and supporting national prosecution efforts related to the civil war.

Justice Lenaola's election to lead this vital institution further solidifies Kenya's standing in global judicial bodies, reflecting the nation's commitment to the principles of international law and accountability. His leadership is expected to strengthen the RSCSL's ongoing work in upholding justice and managing the Court's remaining duties efficiently.
