## Azziad Nasenya’s 3-Ingredient Hack for Flowers Fresh!

Azziad Nasenya, the Kenyan content creator and actress, has recently shared her ingenious three-ingredient method to keep cut flowers vibrant and fresh for an impressive period of up to 10 days, or even longer. This simple household trick involves readily available items: sugar, vinegar, and a dash of bleach.

### What is Azziad Nasenya's 3-Ingredient Hack?

Right, so Azziad, being the generous soul she is, let her "fam" in on a little secret she'd apparently picked up a couple of years back. After treating herself to a lovely bunch of flowers - [Honestly, who doesn't love a good self-care moment?] - she showcased her secret concoction. Her go-to involves a couple of tablespoons of sugar, a few bottle tops of vinegar, and a couple of bottle tops of a product often referred to as 'Jik' in Kenya, which is essentially bleach. All these bits and bobs get mixed right into the vase water. Simple as that!

### Why This 3-Ingredient Hack Keeps Flowers Fresh

Well, it's all a bit clever, really. The sugar acts as a food source, giving those thirsty blooms the nutrients they need to keep looking perky. Then, the vinegar swoops in to add a touch of acidity, which helps the flowers absorb water more efficiently. And the bleach? That's the unsung hero, warding off any pesky bacteria that would otherwise turn your beautiful bouquet into a slimy mess rather quickly. [Nobody wants that, do they?] This genius combination means your flowers can resist wilting for ages, with Azziad claiming they can last for eight, nine, or even up to fourteen days - far exceeding the usual week.

Anyway, this isn't the first time we've seen a celebrity giving flowers, or talking about them, in the headlines. Just recently, Ruth K was making waves, quite literally, giving Willy Paul his flowers and calling him 'undeniably talented'. You can read all about that particular drama right here: [Ruth K Gives Willy Paul His Flowers: Calls Him 'Undeniably Talented'](https://zandani.co.ke/article/ruth-k-gives-willy-paul-his-flowers-calls-him-undeniably-talented). But back to Azziad's little trick, it’s certainly a blooming good idea for anyone wanting their floral arrangements to last a bit longer! [Who knew a bit of kitchen chemistry could be so glamorous?]
