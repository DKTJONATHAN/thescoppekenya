Haki, fam! The streets are still buzzing after Super Bowl LX kwa California, and let me tell you, Bad Bunny just set the whole place on fire, then Governor Gavin Newsom came through with the petrol!

Yesterday, February 8, 2026, California officially declared it "Bad Bunny Day". Governor Newsom, clearly in a mood to ruffle some feathers, made the declaration to celebrate the Puerto Rican superstar headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show. And if that wasn't enough to get the chokoras talking, the governor took a direct jab at MAGA loyalist Kid Rock, joking about him being "banned" from the Golden State and calling his music "terrible". Talk about throwing shade like a pro!

Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, made history, you hear me? He was the first Latino solo artist to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, doing his thing almost entirely in Spanish! The man brought the whole *fiesta* to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, serving up hits from his album "Debí Tirar Más Fotos" fresh off his 2026 Grammy Album of the Year win. Guest appearances? Oh, he had them! Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin popped in, making it a proper spectacle. The performance was a whole vibe, showcasing rich Latin culture with scenes of Puerto Rican landscapes, dominoes, and even a piragua stand.

But you know it wouldn't be a proper shindig without some drama. Former President Donald Trump, bless his heart, apparently called the announcement "absolutely ridiculous". Meanwhile, activists were busy distributing "ICE OUT" rally towels with Bad Bunny's image, a clear message against immigration policies, because even the Super Bowl can't escape the politics, ama? Bad Bunny himself, fresh from the Grammys, had already made a powerful statement: "ICE out! We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens, we are humans!"

Today, the internet is still on fire with reactions. From celebrities like Ben Stiller, Jalen Brunson, and Victor Cruz praising the "cultural game changer" performance, to others just enjoying the pure lit energy. Ricky Martin himself said he needed "several hours to even begin processing the tsunami of emotions" after his guest appearance. It's clear Bad Bunny's Super Bowl takeover was more than just a show; it was a whole cultural moment that left everyone talking, from the White House to your mama's *shamba*. The man came, he saw, he conquered, and he did it all in Spanish. *Wueh!*
