## The Hamstring That Only Heals with Champagne?
Tea Squad, pull up a chair because this one is piping hot! Imagine being a top-tier striker in the French Ligue 1, earning millions of shillings, and then telling your club you’re too "injured" to play. We all felt sorry for our Harambee Stars captain, didn't we? We were even planning a national prayer day for his "hamstring injury." But wait—Kwani, does a hamstring injury require a 40-year-old whiskey and a VIP table in Kilimani? 

## Spotted: The Evidence is Loud!
Over the weekend, while his team was getting thrashed 3-0 back in Europe, our "Golden Boy" was spotted at a popular high-end club in Kilimani. And let me tell you, he wasn't there to drink water! Wueh! My sources tell me the bill was looking like a small car’s price tag. He was surrounded by "slay queens" and a few of his boys, looking very much unbothered by the fact that he was supposed to be in a rehabilitation clinic in Marseille. 

## The Agent is Sweating!
Imagine the panic! I hear his European agent has been calling him frantically, but the phone is "mteja." If the club finds out he jetted back to Nairobi secretly without permission, that 500-million shilling contract might just grow wings and fly away. Mambo ni mengi, masaa ni machache! Is it a mid-life crisis at 27, or has the fame finally gotten to his head?

## What This Means for Harambee Stars
With the World Cup qualifiers coming up next month, fans are fuming. How can the captain be so reckless? While other players are training hard in the sun, our boy is busy chasing "vibes and inshallah." We love our stars, but this level of discipline is giving "relegation energy." 

Tea Master’s advice? Take care of the goose that lays the golden eggs, otherwise, you'll be back in the local league playing on "potato patches" before you can say "Goal!" 

What do you think, Tea Squad? Is he just "living his best life," or is this the end of a career? Drop your comments!
