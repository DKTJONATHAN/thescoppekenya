## Courtois' Cracking Confrontation: Vini Jr's Attitude Adjustment at Real Madrid

Right, so the latest chatter from the Bernabéu is an absolute corker, isn't it, mate? Apparently, Real Madrid's towering goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, was the only one brave enough to actually tell Vinicius Junior to pull his socks up. And judging by Vini Jr's recent performances, it seems the frank discussion might have actually worked a treat!

This season, Vinicius Junior has certainly been putting in the hard yards, with a respectable 13 goals and 9 assists across 37 appearances in all competitions for Real Madrid. His form has genuinely picked up, bagging six goals in his last five matches, which is a pretty decent return for any forward. But it seems there was a period earlier in the season where his attitude, rather than his artistry, was making headlines.

### The Truth Teller in the Dressing Room

According to reports from Spain, Courtois, bless his brutally honest cotton socks, reportedly "told him to his face what nobody in the Real Madrid dressing room dared to say" when the Brazilian was "performing poorly." He was apparently "very critical of him privately, asking him to forget about controversies and focus exclusively on his commitments to the team." Talk about being a voice of reason when it's needed most - much like how some might argue for institutions to be a moral compass in society, as discussed in "Church be Voice of Reason in 2027 or Allow Takeover by Politicians? A Critical Reflection".

And credit where credit's due, it seems Vini Jr listened! The report suggests Courtois had "several conversations with him in the locker room, hoping he would change, which he finally has," and the big Belgian has since congratulated him on his current form. You just love to see a bit of proper leadership, don't you?

### Contract Conundrums and Mbappe's Millions

Now, while Vini Jr's on-pitch exploits are sparkling, his contractual situation is still a bit murky. The 25-year-old is reportedly out of contract in the summer of 2027, and Real Madrid are apparently struggling to agree on a renewal. Why, you ask? Well, it's all down to the pennies, or rather, the millions, with Vini Jr reportedly wanting "parity with top-earner Kylian Mbappe."

And yes, Kylian Mbappe *is* indeed a Real Madrid player, having joined on a five-year deal in June 2024. He's currently the highest-paid player at the club, raking in a cool €31.3 million per year. So, Vini Jr's got his sights set high, hasn't he?

Interestingly, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano had hinted back in January that Vini Jr's contract renewal might become "less complicated" after Xabi Alonso was sacked earlier this year. And indeed, Xabi Alonso, who was only appointed as Real Madrid's head coach in June 2025, was dismissed in January 2026 after a mere seven months in charge, with Álvaro Arbeloa stepping in as interim manager. It seems the managerial merry-go-round at the Bernabéu continues!

### Transfer Tittle-Tattle

Of course, with contract talks dragging, the rumour mill is churning faster than a dodgy washing machine. Manchester City are reportedly keeping a very close eye on the situation, with whispers suggesting they've even advised Vini Jr to hold off on signing a new deal until 2027, possibly aligning with Pep Guardiola's own contract situation. And if that wasn't enough, his boyhood club Flamengo has also publicly expressed their desire for him to return one day.

It's absolute madness, isn't it? One minute he's supposedly 'performing poorly,' then a stern word from his goalkeeper sets him straight, and now half of Europe wants him! Only at Real Madrid, eh?
