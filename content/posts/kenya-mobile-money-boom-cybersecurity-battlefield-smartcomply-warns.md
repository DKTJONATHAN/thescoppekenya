## The Kenya's Mobile Money Boom Faces a Cybersecurity Battlefield

Kenya's rapidly evolving digital economy, largely driven by its robust mobile money ecosystem, now confronts a significant cybersecurity battlefield. A recent report, "AI & the Cyber Frontier: Securing East Africa's Digital Future," launched on February 26, 2026, by Nigerian-founded governance, risk, and compliance technology company Smartcomply, highlights the urgent need for enhanced security measures as digital innovation outpaces defensive capabilities. The report underscores that the nation's reliance on mobile-first financial services, while a strength, also represents its most exposed digital surface.

### Smartcomply Warns Against Underestimated Risks

Smartcomply's findings paint a concerning picture of East Africa's cyber risk landscape, particularly for Kenya. The nation's financial system has transformed dramatically, with mobile money facilitating over 53% of its GDP and more than 90% of Kenyans registered on the national digital identity platform. This deeply interconnected infrastructure, however, is now under sustained attack. Between July and September 2025, the Communications Authority of Kenya’s National KE-CIRT/CC reported 842 million cyber threat events, resulting in an estimated KES 29.9 billion (about US$230 million) lost to cybercrime during the same period. Mobile banking fraud cases surged by 87% in the reporting period from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by SIM-swap schemes, credential theft, and social engineering attacks.

### The Evolving Cybersecurity Battlefield: AI and Sophisticated Attacks

The nature of cybercrime has evolved beyond traditional phishing emails, with artificial intelligence reshaping attack vectors, speed, and detection difficulty. Globally, 60% of organisations believe they have faced AI-enabled attacks, yet only 7% possess adequate defenses, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report. This widening gap between offensive and defensive capabilities is acutely felt across East Africa. In Tanzania, deepfake fraud attempts reportedly surged by 317% in a single review period, while Uganda witnessed attackers coordinating over 2,000 SIM cards to drain UGX 11 billion from banks and telecoms in the Pegasus Technologies breach. These incidents highlight how automation enables small groups of attackers to operate at a scale previously requiring extensive human resources.

Despite Kenya's ranking among Africa's strongest countries in cybersecurity by the International Telecommunication Union, with only about 0.3% of attempted system breaches succeeding, the increasing digital maturity also expands the attack surface. As more services migrate online, the digital economy becomes a larger target for cybercriminals. This growing threat is acknowledged by East African organisations, with over 70% citing cyber risk as their top concern, exceeding the global average. However, only 29% of firms in the region have conducted drills to test their incident response plans, indicating a significant "execution gap" between awareness and operational readiness.

### Resilience Beyond Compliance: A New Approach for Kenya's Mobile Money Boom

Smartcomply's report argues that a compliance-driven security culture, often focused on documentation and regulatory checkboxes, is insufficient for true resilience. The company advocates for embedding security into product architecture, procurement decisions, team training, and crisis rehearsals from the outset, rather than as an afterthought. Gbemisola Osunrinde, CEO of Smartcomply, emphasizes that "Resilience improves when organisations plan for failure instead of assuming stability. The shift from reactive fixes to deliberate design is what ultimately builds long-term trust".

The issue is compounded by structural blind spots, such as unregulated technology connecting banks to mobile wallets, which attackers exploit. To address this, Kenya has been proactive in strengthening its legal framework. The Computer Misuse & Cybercrimes (Amendment) Act 2024, which became effective in November 2025, expands coverage to include phishing, SIM-swap fraud, and identity theft, while also mandating stronger compliance for critical infrastructure and imposing heavier penalties. Furthermore, in January 2026, the European Union launched the Kenya Cyber Resilience (KCR) project, providing KES 454 million (approximately EUR 3 million) to bolster Kenya's national cybersecurity ecosystem, focusing on regulatory frameworks, operational capabilities, and digital awareness. These efforts complement the existing National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022-2027.

### Strengthening Defenses in the Cybersecurity Battlefield

For platforms like M-Pesa and the broader mobile payments ecosystem, effective cybersecurity is not merely an abstract concept; it is crucial for daily economic stability, impacting businesses, salaries, remittances, and household cash flow. The current cybersecurity battlefield demands a proactive, integrated approach to security that goes beyond mere compliance. As Kenya continues to expand public access to essential services, as seen with initiatives like Huduma Centres introducing Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority services, the underlying digital infrastructure must be fortified to ensure sustained trust and resilience. The strength and growth of Kenya's digital economy directly correlate with the need for robust, pre-emptive cybersecurity measures to safeguard its future.
