## Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya's Youth Lead in Global Mental Health Survey

A recent mental health survey conducted by Sapien Labs positions young adults in Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya among the highest globally for mind health, a finding that offers both reassurance and a warning for the region's long-term economic stability and workforce productivity.

Kenyan young adults, specifically, rank third out of 84 countries in mental health, achieving an average Mind Health Quotient (MHQ) score of 63. This contrasts sharply with a widening global mental health crisis, which now affects over four in ten young adults worldwide. The report underscores the significant implications for business leaders and policymakers, as the 18-34 cohort forms the bedrock of the global labor force pipeline. A sustained deterioration in cognitive and emotional capacity on this scale risks lowering productivity growth, increasing healthcare burdens, and weakening long-term economic performance. According to a January 2026 report, global labour productivity is projected to grow at a moderate, but uneven pace in 2026 across countries, with productivity gains remaining particularly weak in low-income economies. Furthermore, employee engagement globally fell to 21% in 2024, with the decline costing the global economy $438 billion in lost productivity by 2025.

## Understanding the Global Mental Health Survey Context

The Sapien Labs report, spearheaded by founder and chief scientist Tara Thiagarajan, assessed a broad spectrum of capacities crucial for navigating life's challenges. It revealed that many young adults globally struggle with emotional control, interpersonal relationships, and the ability to focus, alongside prevalent depression and anxiety. Tara Thiagarajan, a neuroscientist and entrepreneur, founded Sapien Labs to build a holistic, global understanding of the evolving brain and mind. The survey indicates a consistent generational gap across many nations, with older adults generally exhibiting markedly stronger mind health scores. In Kenya, for example, young adults' average MHQ score of 63 is significantly lower than the 107 recorded among Kenyans aged 55 and above. This divergence intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic and has remained largely unchanged over the past five years.

An inverse relationship appears between national wealth and youth mind health outcomes, with young adults in high-income economies like the U.S. (58th with a score of 36) and the U.K. (81st with a score of 20) clustering near the bottom of the rankings. This stark contrast highlights the potential protective cultural and lifestyle factors present in Sub-Saharan Africa. David Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College and a fellow at Sapien Labs, stressed the urgency of addressing root causes, noting that "almost half of all young adults globally, the heart of the workforce, are struggling with an array of mental health challenges, that means we are facing a crisis that can undermine the health of entire economies and societies."

## Addressing Root Causes: Digital Exposure and Lifestyle Factors for Youth Mental Health

The report attributes much of the global decline in youth mental health to four interconnected factors: earlier smartphone adoption in childhood, rising consumption of ultra-processed foods, weakening family bonds, and diminished spirituality. Countries were ranked across these dimensions, revealing sharp contrasts.

Kenya ranks 14th globally in youth spirituality, defined as a sense of connection to a higher power, and 73rd in ultra-processed food consumption among young adults, indicating a relatively low intake. Higher spirituality scores and lower consumption of ultra-processed foods are strongly associated with improved mind health outcomes in the data. Young adults with high spirituality ratings scored approximately 20 MHQ points higher than those with very low ratings. Concurrently, mind health systematically declines with greater consumption of ultra-processed foods, which researchers estimate account for 15% to 30% of the mental health burden.

Regarding digital exposure, respondents aged 18 to 24 who acquired smartphones at younger ages were more likely to report adult struggles across emotional control, focus, and relationships. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, reported later average ages of smartphone adoption compared with wealthier peers. This insight is particularly relevant in a rapidly evolving media landscape, as explored in "Navigating the Digital Reality for Media in Kenya: Opportunities and Challenges in a Connected Future." Family cohesion also plays a measurable role, with respondents reporting poor family relationships being nearly four times more likely to fall into distressed or struggling MHQ categories than those with close family ties.

## Kenya's Economic Resilience Amidst Mental Health Survey Findings

While Sub-Saharan Africa generally outperforms higher-income regions in youth mental health, the generational divide persists within African countries. The global decline in mind health affects all regions, albeit to varying degrees. For economies such as Kenya, these findings offer both reassurance regarding existing protective buffers and a warning. Without deliberate policies addressing digital exposure, nutrition, and family stability, the downward pressures observed in wealthier economies could intensify over time.

Kenya's economy is projected to demonstrate robust growth in 2026, with forecasts from Diamond Trust Bank (DTB) and the National Treasury anticipating an acceleration to 5.3%, building on an estimated 5.0% in 2025. Other projections place GDP growth between 5.2% and 5.5%. This positive outlook is underpinned by improved agricultural output, a burgeoning services sector, and increased diaspora remittances. Inflation is expected to average 5.0% in 2026, remaining within the government's target range. Capital markets have also shown strong performance, with the NSE 20 Share Index rising 52.4% in January 2026 compared to January 2025, and total market capitalisation increasing by over 55%. This economic resilience, characterised by a resurgence in capital markets and strategic trade partnerships, provides a vital backdrop against which the implications of youth mental health must be considered. The focus on human capability and performance enhancement is critical, as productivity in 2026 will stem from leaders who can redesign work structures and amplify human capability, rather than relying on tighter oversight.
