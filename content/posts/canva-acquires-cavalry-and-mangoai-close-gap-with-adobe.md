## Canva Acquires Cavalry and MangoAI to Enhance Creative Workflow

Canva has announced the acquisition of UK-based 2D animation software studio Cavalry and US-based AI startup MangoAI. These strategic moves are designed to bolster Canva's professional creative offerings and accelerate its competitive positioning against industry giant Adobe.

### Canva's Strategic Play: Why Cavalry and MangoAI?

The recent acquisitions of Cavalry and MangoAI underscore Canva's ambitious drive to expand its ecosystem and provide a comprehensive suite for professional creatives. Cavalry, a small UK studio, specialises in 2D animation software, which has gained a following among designers as a more accessible alternative to tools like Adobe After Effects for specific tasks. Companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Netflix reportedly utilise Cavalry's technology. Canva intends to continue selling Cavalry as a standalone product while integrating its technology into both its main platform and Affinity, the professional design suite acquired by Canva in 2024. Affinity, which was made free in October 2024, has since surpassed 5 million downloads. The integration of Cavalry into Affinity is expected to provide motion editing capabilities, thereby completing a professional suite encompassing photo, vector, layout, and now motion editing.

MangoAI, an early-stage US startup, focuses on optimising video advertisements using reinforcement learning. Its system monitors ad performance across platforms, then uses these insights to adapt and refine content - for instance, by adjusting video length or splicing effective calls-to-action. This technology will be integrated into Canva Grow, Canva's marketing tool available on its business tier at $250 per person per year. MangoAI's co-founder, Nirmal Govind, a former Vice President of Data Science & Engineering at Netflix, will become Canva's first Chief Algorithms Officer. This acquisition brings significant data science expertise to Canva's marketing products, focusing on performance-driven creative outcomes.

### Closing the Gap With Adobe: Financials and Market Position

Canva's recent acquisitions are a clear indication of its intent to intensify competition with Adobe. Canva concluded 2025 with an impressive $4 billion in annualized revenue, serving 265 million users, and maintaining positive free cash flow for nine consecutive years. In contrast, Adobe reported $6.2 billion in revenue during its last quarter, but with a growth rate of only 10%, and its stock experienced a 30% decline this year. This closing financial gap highlights Canva's aggressive expansion strategy.

These acquisitions represent Canva's fifth in two years, following Affinity, Leonardo, and MagicBrief. This pattern reveals a deliberate effort to fill gaps across the professional creative workflow, tool by tool, while maintaining competitive pricing that makes Adobe's offerings appear more expensive. The focus on integrating advanced tools while keeping accessibility high aligns with a broader industry trend where creative platforms are diversifying their offerings to cater to a wider spectrum of users. This strategic approach resonates with discussions around audience engagement and the value of content, as explored in articles like [Nollywood's Art and Audience Debate: The REAL Cost of Calling Viewers 'Unthinking' for Complex Cinema!](https://zandani.co.ke/article/nollywoods-art-audience-debate-unthinking-cinema-cost).

### AI's Role in Canva's Future and the Creative Workflow

Canva's co-founder, Cameron Adams, offers an insightful perspective on AI's role within their strategy. He notes that while generative AI excels at producing most of a finished piece of content, it often struggles with the final, crucial stages-ensuring the content is on-brand, resonates with a specific audience, and performs effectively. This is precisely the gap Canva aims to address and own.

Tools like Cavalry and MangoAI are instrumental in this strategy, as they handle the more precise and performance-driven aspects of creative work. Cavalry enhances motion design, a key element for dynamic content, while MangoAI leverages reinforcement learning to ensure video ads achieve optimal performance. This targeted approach to AI integration, focusing on refinement and outcome optimisation rather than solely generation, positions Canva to offer a powerful and practical solution for businesses seeking to maximise their digital creative output.
