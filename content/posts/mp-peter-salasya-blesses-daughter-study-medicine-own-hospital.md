## MP Peter Salasya Blesses Daughter to Study Medicine and Own a Hospital

Mumias East Member of Parliament, Peter Salasya, has recently captured attention by publicly sharing his ambitious desires for his young daughter's future. He expressed his profound wish for her to pursue a career in medicine, aiming for a higher education than his own, and ultimately establish her own healthcare facility. This revelation has certainly set tongues wagging, hasn't it?

### Peter Salasya's Grand Vision for His Daughter's Medical Future

Well, honestly, it seems MP Peter Salasya is thinking big for his little one! He took to Instagram to share his hopes, explicitly stating, "I bless you, my daughter, I want you to study more than I did so you can become a doctor and open your own hospital in the future." Right, a father's blessing and a career roadmap all in one post. He noted how quickly she's growing, describing her as both beautiful and blossoming.

This rather public declaration comes amidst a period where Salasya has been quite open about his personal life on social media, often connecting with constituents beyond the usual political banter. Interestingly, the MP also used this very post to vehemently reaffirm his parental bond, making it abundantly clear he doesn't need a DNA test for his daughter. "Your mum is dark skin; I am brown skin. I don't even want a DNA test; you are my true blood,” Salasya added. One can't help but wonder if this was a pre-emptive strike against lingering whispers, given previous reports of an elderly man claiming to be Salasya's long-lost father and demanding a DNA test back in August 2025.

### Is Salasya Building a Hospital Empire?

Anyway, the idea of a politician's daughter owning a hospital is quite the dream, isn't it? It certainly raises eyebrows about the kind of influence and resources that might be at play. Peter Salasya himself has been rather vocal about the healthcare sector, particularly criticising the government's Social Health Authority (SHA) rollout and its impact on private hospitals. He's even bemoaned the closure of St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Mumias, calling it a "national failure" that devastated healthcare access. Could his daughter's future hospital be a direct response to these perceived failures, or perhaps a strategic move to solidify a family legacy in a critical sector?

It's not entirely unheard of for influential figures to venture into diverse, sometimes surprising, fields. Much like Pashkiran Reddy's journey in South Africa, where his influential voice in 2026 became about "More Than Just a Celebrity Chef," it seems Salasya is keen for his offspring to make a significant mark beyond traditional expectations.

The Mumias East MP has also, in the past, showcased a newly constructed administration and tuition block at Shianda Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), boasting of his development record in the health and education sectors. This suggests a keen interest in medical infrastructure, doesn't it? One might even say he's laying the groundwork.

### The Buzz Around MP Peter Salasya's Family Life

Honestly, Salasya's personal life has always been a hot topic. He introduced a baby boy in June 2025, and then a daughter, Ameeliah Reign Kalerwa, in December 2025. The announcements of his children, especially as an unmarried politician, have often led to public discussions and questions about his marital status and growing family. But for now, it seems the focus is firmly on little Ameeliah Reign and the rather grand plans her father has for her to study medicine and own a hospital. What a future, eh?
