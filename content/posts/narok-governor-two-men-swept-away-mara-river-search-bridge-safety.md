## Narok Governor Leads Search for Two Men Swept Away in Mara River Amidst Public Grievances

Narok Governor Patrick Ole Ntutu has intensified search and recovery efforts for two men who remain missing after their vehicle plunged into the Mara River on Sunday, February 22. The incident, attributed to heavy flooding, has reignited long-standing public discontent regarding the structural integrity of the Mararianta bridge and the broader state of infrastructure in Narok County. The vehicle involved has been retrieved, but the occupants are yet to be found.

### The Ongoing Search and Rescue Operation in Mara River

Governor Ntutu confirmed his presence at Mara Rianta on Thursday, February 26, to personally oversee the search for the two individuals, identified as a driver and passenger whose tourist vehicle was overwhelmed by the swollen river. "I am currently at Mara Rianta to lead the search and recovery efforts for the two young men whose vehicle was swept away by the Mara River floods this past Sunday night," Ntutu stated on his social media platforms. Narok County Police Commander Patrick Lobolia has indicated that rescue operations are challenged by the presence of crocodiles and hippopotamuses in the affected river section. The Governor has extended condolences to the families and urged residents to exercise extreme caution during the ongoing rainy season, particularly when approaching flooded waterways.

### Local Outcry Over Mararianta Bridge Conditions

The tragic incident has brought into sharp focus the deplorable condition of the Mararianta bridge, a critical link between Transmara and Narok towns. Residents have expressed significant grievances, accusing the county government of neglecting the bridge's rehabilitation despite repeated allocations of development funds. Locals assert that the bridge, allegedly constructed during the colonial era, has seen minimal meaningful upgrades and has claimed lives in previous incidents. Governor Ntutu acknowledged these concerns, stating, "I am engaging the relevant authorities to urgently address the long-standing concern regarding the elevation of the Mara Rianta Bridge, which has repeatedly claimed lives during periods of heavy rainfall". This commitment comes amidst public demands for concrete solutions to prevent future fatalities.

### Broader Infrastructure Challenges and Flood Response in Narok

This incident is not isolated, reflecting a wider challenge of infrastructure resilience against heavy rainfall in Narok County. Just days prior, the Mogor Bridge, connecting Trans Mara South and North, was also damaged by floods. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) had on February 23, 2026, announced the closure of the Mogor Bridge due to flash floods washing away its approaches, rendering the road impassable. However, the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) has since announced the successful reinstatement of the Mogor Bridge on February 26, 2026, restoring connectivity for motorists. The Kenya Meteorological Department had earlier issued a four-day heavy rainfall advisory from February 21 to February 24, 2026, for various regions, including Narok, highlighting the meteorological context of these incidents.

The immediate focus remains on recovering the two missing individuals from the Mara River. However, the political imperative to address long-term infrastructure deficiencies, particularly the Mararianta bridge, is now undeniable. As the nation grapples with varied governance challenges and triumphs, such as the [Kenya Navy's election to lead the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium for 2030-2032](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenya-navy-elected-lead-indian-ocean-naval-symposium-2030-2032), the persistent local issues in Narok underscore the critical need for equitable and resilient development across all counties.
