## AFCON 2027 Budget: Parliament Rejects Bid to Increase Funding

The National Assembly Committee on Culture and Sports recently rejected a proposal from Kenya's Ministry of Sports to increase the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations budget from KSh 3.5 billion to KSh 7.5 billion, citing co-hosting as a reason for potential cost reduction.

Kenya, alongside Uganda and Tanzania, is gearing up to co-host the prestigious AFCON 2027 tournament, a monumental undertaking for East Africa. However, concerns are mounting regarding the region's infrastructure readiness, with construction works still ongoing across all three nations. The much-anticipated Talanta Stadium in Nairobi is expected to be completed by February 2026.

### The Debate: Cost to Host AFCON and Kenya's Financial Commitments

The Ministry of Sports and the Local Organising Committee (LOC) recently benchmarked in Morocco, which successfully hosted AFCON 2025. Following this, they proposed to the National Assembly to raise the AFCON 2027 budget from KSh 3.5 billion to KSh 7.5 billion. This proposed increase, however, does not include the KSh 3.5 billion that Kenya is required to pay to CAF as a hosting fee. While Uganda and Tanzania have already fulfilled their payment obligations, Kenya is still in the process of remitting its $30 million (approximately KSh 3.9 billion) contribution to CAF, with a deadline set for April 2026.

Principal Secretary Elijah Mwangi explained that the additional funds were intended to cover essential expenses such as security and catering. However, the committee, led by chair Dan Wanyama, rejected the proposal, arguing that the cost should be lower given the tournament's co-hosting nature. This firm stance from Parliament highlights a critical challenge for Kenya's AFCON 2027 preparations, as the country faces pressure to secure alternative funding to meet its CAF commitments.

### Understanding the Investment: How Other Nations Host AFCON

The question of how much it truly takes to host AFCON is complex, with no single figure applicable across the board, as preparations range from stadium renovations to service provision. The scale of investment by previous and upcoming hosts provides valuable context. Morocco, for instance, invested approximately €2.3 billion (KSh 348 billion) as part of its broader strategy to prepare for AFCON 2025 and the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. This substantial investment covered upgrading nine world-class stadiums and renovating road networks, airports, and various services. Morocco's successful hosting of AFCON 2025 generated direct revenues exceeding 1 billion euros and attracted hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors.

Ivory Coast, the host and winner of AFCON 2023, reportedly spent around $1 billion (KSh 129 billion) on building four new stadiums, renovating two existing ones, and upgrading road networks, hospitals, and hotels, according to BBC. It is important to note that these figures from Morocco and Ivory Coast include significant renovation and construction costs, unlike Kenya's KSh 7.5 billion proposal, which does not factor in the expenses for building Talanta Stadium or renovating other facilities.

### The Return on Investment for Hosting AFCON

Hosting a major tournament like AFCON often yields substantial returns. Morocco's Industry and Commerce Minister, Ryad Mezzour, reported that AFCON 2025 attracted 600,000 tournament-specific tourists, with the Kingdom recouping KSh 227.52 billion of its investment. Beyond financial gains, such events create numerous job opportunities for the youth, with Morocco's minister estimating 100,000 new jobs were created by AFCON 2025. CAF also hailed the Morocco tournament as the most profitable in history, boasting 2 billion viewers and 10 billion social media views.

### Infrastructure Development and AFCON 2027 Readiness

While Kenya faces budget hurdles, progress is being made in co-host Uganda. The Hoima City Stadium, a 20,000-seater facility featuring a swimming pool, volleyball, and basketball courts, was officially commissioned by President Yoweri Museveni in December 2025, four months ahead of schedule. This development underscores Uganda's commitment to the joint "East Africa Pamoja" bid.

The readiness of all three East African nations remains a key focus for CAF, with President Patrice Motsepe affirming in February 2026 that AFCON 2027 will proceed as planned in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. CAF inspection teams have been actively touring the region to assess stadium quality, training sites, and overall infrastructure. Kenya's Local Organising Committee chairman Nicholas Musonye has expressed ambitions for Kenya to host more matches by ensuring three quality stadiums are ready, including Talanta Stadium, Kasarani, and an improved Nyayo Stadium.

The journey to AFCON 2027 is proving to be a true test of resolve and resourcefulness for Kenya. As the nation navigates these financial and infrastructural demands, it is a reminder that sports extend beyond the pitch, influencing national development and international standing.
