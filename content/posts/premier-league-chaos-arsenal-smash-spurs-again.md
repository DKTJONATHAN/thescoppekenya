Psst! Have you heard? I've got a little secret to spill, and honestly, you won't believe the drama that unfolded this Sunday in the Premier League!

## So, Did Arsenal Actually DEMOLISH Tottenham Again?

Oh, they absolutely did, mate! Arsenal went and crushed Tottenham Hotspur with a mighty 4-1 victory in the North London derby. This wasn't just any win, it was their second time thumping Spurs this season, putting them a full five points clear at the top of the Premier League table. What a statement!

**The Scoop: North London is a Mess!**

Honestly, you could hear the gasps from here! Eberechi Eze, bless his boots, he was just absolutely on fire! He matched legends like Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie, bagging a brace against Spurs. And get this, he’d already scored a hat-trick against them earlier in the season! Five goals against Tottenham in just two games - talk about rubbing salt in the wound! Arsenal, who apparently were 'under huge pressure' after losing to Wolves midweek (can you even imagine?), made everyone who doubted them look a bit silly. They ran riot at their neighbours' place, leaving Spurs firmly stuck in the relegation muck. What a nightmare for Tottenham fans, eh?

And speaking of Spurs, guess who rocked up? None other than Dele Alli! He was the half-time Guest of Honour, looking all emotional. But wait, he teased an 'imminent return' to professional football! Honestly, the gossip is flying - could he really be back on the pitch so soon? (One can only hope, right?). It’s like something out of a movie!

**The Evidence: More Mayhem Across the League!**

It wasn't just north London having all the fun, oh no. Liverpool had their own little drama. Florian Wirtz, the Germany international, got pulled from the starting XI just before their game against Nottingham Forest. Boss Arne Slot is saying it’s not 'serious,' but honestly, when are these things ever *not* serious, eh? Luckily for the Reds, Alexis Mac Allister, the Argentina international, scored a last-minute winner in the 96th minute! Imagine the uproar! VAR tried to spoil the party earlier, but he wasn’t having any of it. Forest must be absolutely fuming, consigned to a 'damaging defeat' without Wirtz. It makes you wonder, doesn't it, about the sheer pressure these lads are under? And it’s not just players dealing with big demands; the UN Boss is apparently shaking his fist and demanding cash for Africa's young! Honestly, everyone wants a piece of the pie, don't they? [cite: https://zandani.co.ke/posts/un-africa-youth-jobs-investment-demand]

And then there's Casemiro. The Manchester United star is apparently off to Inter Miami when his contract ends in June. Lionel Messi's new 'right-hand man,' they're saying! Imagine that! A real shake-up, that one.

**The Verdict: What a Week, Eh?**

So, there you have it. Goals galore, comebacks teased, injuries, and last-gasp winners. If you want to watch all this unfold, honestly, it costs an arm and a leg! Virgin Media or EE TV seem to be the 'most cost efficient' if you’re already a customer, with TNT Sports for £12 a month and Sky Sports for £31.75. Or there's EE TV’s 'Big Sport deal' for £45. And don't forget Amazon Prime for those 'few weeks'! But if you’re a Sky TV bod, you can get the 'Complete Sky Sports package' for an extra £22 a month. Blimey, it’s a minefield just to watch the beautiful game! Still, what a cracking weekend of football, eh? You just can’t make this stuff up!
