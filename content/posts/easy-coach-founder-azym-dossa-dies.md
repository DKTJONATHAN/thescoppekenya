## Easy Coach Founder Azym Dossa Dies: A Legacy of Transformation

Azym Dossa, the visionary Easy Coach founder and former Managing Director, passed away on Thursday, February 26, 2026, marking the end of an era in Kenya's transport industry. His death has prompted widespread mourning for a leader who revolutionized long-distance travel with an unwavering commitment to safety and customer service. Easy Coach confirmed his passing, describing him as a pillar behind the company's growth and identity over two decades.

The news of Dossa's demise, announced by Easy Coach in a statement on Thursday, February 26, 2026, has been met with profound sadness across the nation. The company lauded him as a visionary leader whose guidance and dedication shaped Easy Coach from its inception, establishing values that continue to define its operations. His passing is considered a significant loss to the company and the broader business community. A funeral service is scheduled for Saturday, February 28, 2026, at the Aga Khan Cultural and Religious Centre in Parklands, Nairobi, followed by burial at the Ismaili Cemetery.

### The Visionary Journey of Easy Coach Founder Azym Dossa

Azym Dossa's entrepreneurial journey in Kenya's transport sector began in 2003, reportedly after he returned from Canada at the age of 50 to establish Easy Coach from the ground up. Despite initial discouragement, he launched the company with a modest fleet of seven buses, transforming it into a major transport brand renowned for its stringent safety standards, structured booking systems, and dedicated passenger lounges. This customer-focused model, prioritizing comfort and safety, was widely credited to Dossa's innovative approach to long-distance travel.

Before conceptualizing Easy Coach, Dossa honed his expertise during nearly two decades as Chief Financial Officer at Akamba Bus, gaining invaluable experience and a unique perspective on the industry. His transition from employment to entrepreneurship marked a pivotal moment, as he meticulously built Easy Coach into a company operating dozens of buses across key routes in Kenya and the wider region. He consistently emphasized proper planning, disciplined management, and ethical conduct as core values that ensured the company's stability and growth, even through challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Leadership Transition Preceded Easy Coach Founder Azym Dossa's Passing

Dossa had stepped down from active leadership in early 2025 due to health challenges and advancing age, handing over the day-to-day management to Zulfiqar Adatia, the company's technical director, who was appointed Managing Director. In a memo to staff at the time, Dossa cited that this was not an easy decision but felt it was the right moment for him to step down, assuring staff of his continued guidance in an advisory capacity. His retirement marked the end of a 20-year tenure at the helm, during which he shaped Easy Coach into a respected brand known for its reliability and customer-centric solutions.

The legacy of Azym Dossa stands as a testament to ethical leadership and a strategic vision that prioritized service excellence over mere profit. In a country where public service delivery and accountability remain critical discussions, often highlighted by debates such as those on [Devolution Was Never Meant to Be a Feeding Trough: A Crisis of Credibility](https://zandani.co.ke/article/devolution-never-meant-to-be-feeding-trough-credibility-crisis), Dossa's disciplined approach in the private sector offers a compelling case study. His contribution to the transport sector and his role in building Easy Coach into a recognized brand will remain a lasting part of Kenya’s economic history. The company, its shareholders, management, and staff have extended their deepest condolences to his family and loved ones, praying for eternal peace and strength for those affected by his loss.
