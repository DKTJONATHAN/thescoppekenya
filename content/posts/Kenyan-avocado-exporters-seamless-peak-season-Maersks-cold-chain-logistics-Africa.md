## Kenyan Avocado Exporters Prepare for Seamless Peak Season

Kenyan avocado exporters are poised for a seamless peak season in 2026, supported by strategic initiatives from Maersk Kenya. The logistics giant is enhancing its cold chain capabilities through training, optimized capacity, and resource positioning, aiming to ensure reliable and uninterrupted transport for Kenya's crucial avocado exports. This preparedness is vital as global demand for Kenyan avocados continues to rise, driving foreign exchange earnings and supporting thousands of livelihoods across the agricultural value chain.

## Enhancing Maersk's Cold Chain Logistics Africa for Reliability

Maersk Kenya has announced comprehensive measures to support Kenyan avocado exporters, focusing on both on-the-ground engagement and digital solutions. These initiatives are designed to ensure the integrity of produce reaching international markets.

### Strategic Training and Operational Excellence for Kenyan Avocado Exporters

Maersk teams are conducting specialized on-site technical training at packhouses throughout Kenya. These sessions cover critical areas such as reefer container handling and cold chain process management, equipping exporters with the technical knowledge to maintain optimal temperature conditions across the supply chain. Complementing this, online training and refresher courses are addressing customs processes, required documentation, and updated information on routing options and transit times to destination markets.

To meet the anticipated surge in demand from Kenyan avocado exporters, Maersk has also implemented robust operational measures. This includes strategically positioning empty reefer containers in key export zones for immediate availability and prioritizing vessels on the Kenya-Europe route with additional container capacity. Maintaining high schedule reliability is a cornerstone of Maersk's service commitment, ensuring time-sensitive avocado shipments arrive with cargo integrity preserved. Tito Okuku, Managing Director of Maersk East Africa, emphasized the company's commitment, stating, "The avocado season is a critical time for Kenyan exporters, and we are committed to providing not just transportation services, but comprehensive support that empowers our customers to meet the world’s growing demand for premium Kenyan avocados".

## Market Dynamics and Policy Landscape for Kenyan Avocado Exporters

The Kenyan avocado sector is experiencing significant growth and evolving market dynamics. In February 2026, retail avocado prices in Nairobi and Mombasa range between KES 215.98 and KES 219.98 per kilogram, with wholesale prices between US$1.09 and US$1.11 per kilogram. Notably, green-skinned avocado varieties are gaining momentum in export markets, with improved demand and pricing driving a shift, sometimes achieving farmgate prices comparable to Hass avocados. Kenya's total avocado output is projected to increase by approximately 20% in 2026 compared to the previous year, with export volumes expected to be 30-40% higher due to favorable weather conditions. Europe and the Middle East remain primary destinations for Hass avocados.

However, the industry faces regulatory complexities and trade challenges. The Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) closed the avocado export season for sea shipments for the 2025/2026 fiscal year from October 20, 2025, a measure aimed at safeguarding quality standards. Air shipments for Hass, Fuerte, Pinkerton, and Jumbo varieties continue under strict inspection and traceability requirements. Additionally, a complete ban on avocado oil exports by all modes of transport is in effect for 2025/2026.

### Navigating Regulatory Frameworks and Trade Challenges for a Seamless Peak Season

Kenyan avocado exporters must navigate a comprehensive regulatory framework that includes AFA Horticultural Crops Directorate registration, KEPHIS farm and packhouse registration, KRA compliance, and GlobalGAP certification for market access. These requirements ensure quality and safety for international markets. The government is also prioritizing improved port efficiency at Mombasa and Lamu to reduce delays and protect fruit quality as the harvesting season begins. This focus on infrastructure echoes broader conversations about national assets, such as the discussions surrounding the Kenya Pipeline sale [High Court Won't Stop Kenya Pipeline Sale: But What About the REAL Winners, Eh?!](https://zandani.co.ke/article/high-court-won't-stop-kenya-pipeline-sale-real-winners), where efficient logistics remain paramount for economic growth.

Despite these efforts, the agricultural sector has called for urgent 2026 policy reforms to address issues such as the impact of Value Added Tax (VAT) on essential inputs, high compliance costs, unpredictable import levies, and trade disparities, including a 30% duty on Kenyan avocados in some markets. These challenges highlight the need for a predictable and competitive environment to sustain growth and investment. Amidst these factors, new support programs are being rolled out for farmers, including direct purchases and financial assistance for certified seedlings, aiming to boost yields, quality, and market access for smallholder growers. These combined efforts are critical to maintaining Kenya's position as a leading supplier of high-quality avocados to international markets.
