## KRA Guide on How to Generate eTIMS Invoices on eCitizen: Navigating the Digital Tax Imperative

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has issued a comprehensive guide on how to generate Electronic Tax Invoicing Management System (eTIMS) invoices via the eCitizen portal, a pivotal step in Kenya's aggressive drive towards universal tax compliance. This initiative aims to streamline invoicing, enhance tax transparency, and significantly curb revenue leakages across the nation.

### Understanding the eTIMS Mandate and the Role of eCitizen

The eTIMS system represents a fundamental digital transformation in Kenya's tax compliance framework. It is a KRA platform designed to standardise invoicing, improve tax transparency, and seal revenue leakages. For businesses across the country, particularly sole proprietors and individuals, the eCitizen portal has been identified as the most accessible entry point for generating KRA-compliant invoices. The integration of eTIMS with eCitizen is a strategic move by the government to formalise the vast, previously untaxed informal sector, thereby expanding the national revenue base.

Starting January 1, 2026, KRA implemented stricter automated validation of tax returns, cross-referencing declared income and expenses against data within eTIMS, withholding tax records, and customs imports. This means that tax deductions will increasingly depend on transactions being supported by verifiable electronic invoices. A significant compliance turning point for businesses is the understanding that "no eTIMS, no expense deduction".

### Step-by-Step KRA Guide to Generate eTIMS Invoices

The KRA has simplified the process for businesses to generate eTIMS invoices, making compliance more attainable. The steps are as follows:

1.  **eCitizen Account Log In:** Businesses must first visit the eCitizen portal and log in using their existing credentials. This leverages an account already widely used by Kenyans for various government services.
2.  **eTIMS Invoicing Module Access:** Once logged in, users navigate to the eTIMS invoicing module. From there, the option labelled "Create Invoice" initiates the process.
3.  **Enter Buyer’s Details:** Accurate buyer details are crucial. This involves inputting their KRA PIN along with other personal or business information.
4.  **Itemise Goods or Services:** This section requires detailed entry of the product or service name, a brief description, the quantity supplied, and the unit price for each item. Accuracy here is paramount for a valid submission.
5.  **Submit and Generate Invoice:** After reviewing all details, clicking the "Create Invoice" button submits the information. KRA's system processes this immediately, generating a compliant invoice available as a downloadable PDF, complete with a QR code and an eTIMS Control Unit invoice number.

### Alternative Methods and Broader Implications for eTIMS Compliance

Beyond the eCitizen portal, KRA offers alternative solutions to facilitate eTIMS compliance. These include a USSD code (*222#) for offline invoice generation, particularly beneficial for small traders in areas with limited internet connectivity. Additionally, the direct KRA eTIMS portal provides a more comprehensive interface for enterprises with high transaction volumes or complex invoicing requirements.

The KRA's recent integration of eTIMS in nearly 500 petrol stations across the country, as of February 13, 2026, underscores the aggressive rollout and strategic targeting of high-volume sectors to capture real-time transaction data. This concerted effort aligns with the national agenda to achieve fiscal independence and reduce reliance on external debt, demonstrating a robust commitment to internal resource mobilisation.

While the system aims to streamline operations and save small businesses costs by eliminating the need for expensive proprietary hardware, concerns have been raised regarding internet reliability in certain regions and issues of data confidentiality, particularly from professionals like doctors. KRA, however, maintains that invoices only capture transaction details, similar to any other receipt.

This digital mandate is not merely about tax collection; it is about fostering a culture of accountability and transparency across all sectors of the economy. Just as the nation grapples with the complexities of protecting its citizens from exploitation in foreign conflicts, as highlighted in the ongoing discussion around [Kenyans Tricked into Russia-Ukraine War: Fight or Die Scandal Deepens as Families Demand Justice!](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenyans-tricked-russia-ukraine-war-fight-die-scandal-justice), the KRA's eTIMS initiative is another facet of the government's broader strategy to establish order and ensure the welfare and compliance of its populace.

Furthermore, the KRA is set to unveil a special "Merchant Tax Compliance Certificate" specifically for businesses that fully adopt eTIMS. This new certificate will integrate eTIMS compliance, going beyond traditional return filing and payment records, to ensure a level playing field and promote consistent adherence to tax obligations. This signals a new era where digital tax compliance is not merely an option but a foundational requirement for business operation and growth in Kenya.
