## AABNet and partners Drive Conservation of African Livestock Genetic Resources

The African Animal Breeding Network (AABNet) and its partners have released a new open-access guide detailing strategies for conserving Africa's diverse livestock genetic resources. This publication provides essential insights for enhancing productivity, building climate resilience, and fostering sustainable development within the continent's agricultural sector.

While Za Ndani also brings you stories on diverse interests, including insights into [Shubhankar's 48th and Veer's 53rd in Kenya: But What's the *Real* Score Off the Green, Lads?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/shubhankar-veer-kenya-golf-gossip-off-green), our focus today remains firmly on the bedrock of our economy: agriculture. The new guide, titled "African Livestock Genetic Resources and Sustainable Breeding Strategies: Unlocking a Treasure Trove and Guide for Improved Productivity," consolidates extensive research on livestock genetics, breeding, and adaptation strategies specific to Africa. This collaborative effort involves AABNet, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health (CTLGH), and the African Union’s Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR).

### The Critical Role of African Livestock Genetic Resources

Africa hosts approximately one-third of the world’s total livestock population, boasting immense diversity in indigenous cattle, goats, poultry, dromedaries, sheep, rabbits, and donkeys. These locally adapted breeds have evolved over generations, demonstrating remarkable resilience to heat, disease, and variable feed conditions, making them vital for climate adaptation in small-scale and low-input production systems. Protecting these unique genetic traits is crucial, especially as many African livestock breeds face extinction primarily due to indiscriminate crossbreeding with exotic breeds, often driven by a singular focus on higher productivity that overlooks local adaptation strengths.

Dr. Huyam Salih, Director of AU-IBAR, emphasized that Africa’s livestock sector contributes over USD 210 billion annually, yet the continent continues to import products it could produce locally. She underscored that strategic investments in genetic characterization, breeding programmes, and farmer-centered approaches are essential to drive sustainable and resilient livestock systems for Africa’s future.

### Strategic Breeding for Climate Resilience and Productivity

Improving genetics, animal health, and management efficiency is a proven method to increase output while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity. This approach contributes significantly to both climate mitigation and food security. Professor Appolinaire Djikeng, Director General of ILRI, highlighted that "Africa’s livestock genetic diversity is not just a heritage-it is a climate and development tool." He added that science-based breeding strategies can enhance productivity, improve resilience, and lower emissions intensity across African livestock systems.

The new guide advocates for breeding objectives that align with farmer priorities and production realities. Successful genetic improvement programmes must integrate adaptation and mitigation goals, ensure farmer participation in decision-making, and strengthen institutional capacity for data collection, monitoring, and livestock breeding and management. Professor Mizeck Chagunda, Director of CTLGH, stated that "Local breeds are the backbone of climate-resilient African agriculture." He affirmed that protecting and sustainably utilizing these breeds through targeted breeding is vital for safeguarding livelihoods and addressing climate change challenges.

### Kenyan Policies Reinforce Conservation of African Livestock Genetic Resources

Kenya is actively implementing policies to bolster its livestock sector and enhance climate resilience. In January 2026, the Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture and Livestock Development announced the establishment of national animal feed reserves to protect livestock from recurring droughts. This move signifies a shift from reactive crisis management to permanent preparedness, ensuring that hay, silage, and other drought-tolerant fodder are stocked during surplus periods and deployed early during dry spells.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development unveiled the National Livestock Agenda (2025-2035), a comprehensive roadmap prioritizing animal genetics, disease control, feed systems, and value addition. The government is also strengthening animal feed regulations and rolling out a national feed quality index to ensure only quality and nutritious feeds are sold in the market. These reforms aim to double annual milk production and position Kenya as a net exporter of live animals and meat, with productivity gains expected from improved nutrition, genetics, and animal health. Efforts are also underway to expand livestock breeding initiatives to enhance meat and milk quality for international markets, supported by an Animal Identification and Traceability System (ANITRAC) to reduce theft and verify animal origins for export.

### Collaborative Efforts in Conservation of African Livestock Genetic Resources

The launch of this guide positions AABNet, ILRI, CTLGH, AU-IBAR, and their National Partners as leaders in coordinating African livestock genetic improvement and conservation. These organizations emphasize multi-country genetic evaluation to address capacity gaps, professional capacity building to strengthen human capital in animal breeding, advocacy for advanced genetic tools, and robust collaboration to scale breeding programmes. The African food, dairy, livestock, and poultry market is experiencing rapid growth, with the overall African food and agriculture market projected to reach $1 trillion per year by 2030, highlighting the economic importance of these initiatives.

As the continent faces intensified climate challenges, with East Africa experiencing increased droughts, floods, and water scarcity, stakeholders across Africa are prioritizing climate resilience, sustainability, and regenerative practices. It is estimated that up to 50% of commercial-scale farms will adopt at least one form of climate-smart agriculture by 2026. This guide serves as a practical, open-access resource for governments, researchers, and practitioners, providing actionable insights to combat genetic erosion and ensure farmers have access to trustworthy, productive, and adapted animals across Africa and globally.
