## Nairobi Water & Sewer Bills See Significant Increase

Nairobi residents will experience a substantial hike in their water and sewerage charges following the approval of new tariffs by the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) for the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC). This adjustment, covering the 2025/2026 to 2028/2029 period, will particularly impact **low consumption households**, with certain bands seeing water tariffs **jump by Ksh23 and Ksh15** for sewerage.

### Understanding the Impact on Low Consumption Households

The newly gazetted tariffs, effective from February 27, 2026, will disproportionately affect **low consumption households** across the city. Domestic consumers using between one and six cubic metres of water monthly will now pay Ksh68 per cubic metre, a notable increase from the previous Ksh45. Sewerage charges are also set to rise, calculated at 75 percent of the water volume consumed, meaning a noticeable escalation in monthly utility bills even for modest water users. This tariff review is projected to cause bills for these households to surge by as much as 50 percent.

For a typical Nairobi household consuming between 10 and 20 cubic metres per month, water costs will now range from Ksh850 to Ksh1,700, while sewer services will cost between Ksh650 and Ksh1,300. This contrasts sharply with previous charges of approximately Ksh670 to Ksh1,340 for water and Ksh560 to Ksh1,120 for sewerage under the old rates. These increases come at a time when many Kenyan households are already grappling with rising living costs, a scenario not dissimilar to the concerns raised regarding price increases in essential goods like sanitary products, which also have the potential to widen social inequalities.

### Justification for the Jump by Ksh23 and Ksh15

NCWSC applied for the tariff review in line with Section 72 (1) (b) of the Water Act, 2016, a process that included extensive public consultation as mandated by Section 139 of the Act. WASREB has deemed the upward tariff review justified, citing the necessity for NCWSC to enhance service delivery, operate sustainably, and safeguard consumer interests by fulfilling the conditions attached to the tariff.

The water company attributes the need for increased revenue to severe operational and infrastructure challenges. Critically, NCWSC is losing approximately 54 percent of its treated water, amounting to Ksh8.5 billion, to leaks, unlawful connections, and other inefficiencies before it reaches consumers. The city also experiences an average of only nine hours of water supply daily, falling significantly short of demand.

### Investment and Compliance Amidst Rising Nairobi Water & Sewer Bills

The revenue generated from these higher tariffs is earmarked for a multi-billion-shilling investment programme. This programme is designed to rehabilitate ageing infrastructure, expand access to water and sewerage services, and modernise systems. NCWSC is already deploying advanced leak detection vans and upgrading metering systems to curb non-revenue water.

To enforce compliance and reduce water theft, the water agency has introduced stricter penalties for unlawful water connections. Commercial and industrial consumers found engaging in such activities face fines of Ksh100,000, while domestic consumers will incur a Ksh30,000 fine, in addition to estimated backdated consumption charges. Furthermore, customers with non-functional meters will be billed based on the average of their last three months' consumption.

This significant adjustment to **Nairobi Water & Sewer Bills** underscores the delicate balance between ensuring the financial viability of essential service providers and safeguarding household budgets, particularly for **low consumption households** navigating a challenging economic landscape.
