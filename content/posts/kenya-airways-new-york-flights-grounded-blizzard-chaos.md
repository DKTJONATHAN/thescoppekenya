Right, love, grab a cuppa because you won't believe the drama unfolding for poor Kenya Airways! Honestly, it's an absolute nightmare for anyone trying to jet off to the Big Apple. The national carrier has had to cancel its flights to and from New York, all thanks to a rather beastly snowstorm over in the States. Can you even imagine being stuck?

## Why were Kenya Airways' New York flights cancelled?

Kenya Airways cancelled its Nairobi-New York route flights, KQ002 and KQ003, because a severe blizzard warning forced John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to suspend operations. The decision, made on Sunday, February 22, 2026, left many travellers stranded due to heavy snowfall and dangerous conditions across the US Northeast.

### The Scoop

Well, darling, it seems our beloved Kenya Airways has found itself in a bit of a pickle! Flight KQ002, which was meant to leave Nairobi on Sunday, February 22, and its return service, KQ003, from New York on Monday, February 23, have both been grounded. Talk about a kerfuffle! Thousands of flights across the US Northeast were cancelled, with JFK being particularly hard hit. Passengers are, understandably, completely stranded on both sides of this super long non-stop route. (What a headache!)

### The Evidence

Kenya Airways themselves released a statement, explaining that a "blizzard warning" and "severe weather conditions" with "heavy snowfall" in New York have completely messed up operations at JFK. Airport authorities just had to suspend all flights for "specific periods" starting Sunday. It's truly rotten luck, especially as this Nairobi-New York service is quite important, being the only direct link between East Africa and New York. Since 2018, it's seen over 300,000 passengers! And this isn't the first time KQ has had weather woes recently; they also grounded flights to Rwanda and Mauritius just last Sunday due to poor visibility.

### The Verdict

Honestly, this whole thing is a bit of a blow for the airline and, more importantly, for all those poor souls trying to travel. Kenya Airways has said they plan to get KQ002 back in the air on Tuesday, February 24, and KQ003 on Wednesday, February 25. That's "subject to improvement in weather and clearance," mind you. (Fingers crossed, eh?) They've apologised, of course, and told passengers to check their website for updates. So, there you have it, mate - another dramatic chapter in the world of travel!
