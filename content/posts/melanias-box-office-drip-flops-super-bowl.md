Alright, wasee! The streets are talking, and it ain't pretty for Mama Melania's big screen moment. While everyone was busy watching the Super Bowl LX on Sunday, February 8, 2026, the documentary simply titled "Melania" got a serious beating at the box office.

Word on the street is that the flick, which is all about Melania Trump, saw its viewership fall off a cliff over the Super Bowl weekend. The Amazon MGM Studios release, directed by Brett Ratner, only managed to pull in an estimated $2.3 million to $2.4 million, bruh. That's a whopping 67% dip from its opening weekend! It barely clung to the top ten, finishing ninth or tenth for the weekend. Its North American total is sitting at $13.4 million, which sounds like chump change when you hear Amazon MGM splashed $40 million just for the rights and another $35 million on marketing this whole thing. Talk about a wallet workout for minimal gains!

Meanwhile, Sam Raimi's "Send Help" was busy showing everyone how it's done. That film, starring Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien, was still topping the charts for its second weekend, raking in a cool $10 million. It's already bagged $35.8 million domestically and a massive $53.7 million worldwide. It seems folks were more into survival thrills than political memoirs this past Super Bowl weekend.

The Super Bowl weekend is famously a slow period for cinema, with people glued to their screens for the big game. Critics haven't been too kind to "Melania" either, giving it a measly 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, even though the audience score is a wild 99%. Some even whispered about bots juicing the audience numbers, but Rotten Tomatoes said, "nah, fam, verified tickets only."

So, while "Send Help" is still making bank, "Melania" is looking like it needs some serious help to stay afloat. Maybe next time, try a dance movie? Just saying!
