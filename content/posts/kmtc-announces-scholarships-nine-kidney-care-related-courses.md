## KMTC Announces Scholarships for Nine Kidney Care-Related Courses

The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) has announced a significant scholarship programme under the East Africa Centre of Excellence in Urology and Nephrology (EACE-UN) initiative, aimed at strengthening specialised care in kidney-related fields across the nation. This vital opportunity, confirmed by KMTC's Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Oluoch, on Thursday, February 26, 2026, seeks to equip health professionals with advanced skills in a critical medical area. The scholarships, funded by a loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Government of Kenya, underscore a regional commitment to enhancing biomedical sciences and patient outcomes in renal and urological care.

### Understanding the Scope of the Kidney Care-Related Courses

The scholarship programme targets advanced training across nine specialised Higher Diploma programmes and an additional six-month short course. These comprehensive **kidney care-related courses** are strategically designed to address various facets of renal health and technology. Among the Higher Diplomas offered are Medical Engineering with specialisations in Dialysis Equipment, Therapeutic Equipment, and Diagnostic Equipment, vital for maintaining life-saving medical technologies.

Further specialisations include a Higher Diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery (Nephrology), equipping clinical officers with advanced skills in kidney disease diagnosis and management. Nurses can pursue a Higher Diploma in Nephrology Nursing, tailored to enhance patient care in dialysis units, renal wards, and transplant centres. Other key areas include Higher Diplomas in Nutrition and Dietetics (Renal Nutrition), Medical Laboratory Sciences (Renal Technology), Occupational Therapy (Renal Rehabilitation), and Renal Pharmacy. Complementing these, a six-month short course in Renal Transplant Nursing aims to significantly improve transplant outcomes and expand Kenya's capacity for complex renal procedures.

### Application Process for KMTC Announces Scholarships

Prospective candidates seeking these **KMTC announces scholarships** must adhere to a structured application process, with submissions required no later than March 15, 2026. Applicants are advised to visit the official Kenya Medical Training College admissions portal at admissions.kmtc.ac.ke. The process involves logging in or creating an account, completing an online application form, and specifically selecting the EACE-UN scholarship option. Required documents must be uploaded, and applicants are then expected to download, sign, and re-upload the completed form in PDF format.

A crucial step for eligibility is obtaining an unconditional admission offer for the chosen course. Additionally, candidates must attach a handwritten essay of not more than 200 words, articulating their suitability for the scholarship and their projected contribution to the community upon graduation. The scholarship package is comprehensive, covering full tuition fees and providing a stipend to support beneficiaries throughout their studies, though it is subject to the availability of funding.

### Prioritising Expertise for National Impact

The selection process prioritises specific health professionals to maximise the national impact of these specialised **kidney care-related courses**. County government employees, KMTC employees, and applicants with at least three years of work experience at a county health facility will receive preferential consideration. Furthermore, applicants must be registered with their relevant regulatory bodies for their basic training and secure approval and release from their county employers.

This strategic prioritisation aims to deploy highly skilled personnel to areas where they are most needed, ultimately strengthening Kenya's healthcare system. The emphasis on practical experience and employer recommendation ensures that the beneficiaries are not only academically proficient but also poised to make immediate and tangible contributions to public health. Such targeted human capital development is essential for addressing the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases like chronic kidney disease across the nation. The deployment of such vital expertise is crucial for extending quality healthcare services to all regions of Kenya, including those facing unique challenges and hardships, much like the struggles highlighted in our journalist's report on being [Stranded Up North: Our Journalist's Secret Struggles in Drought-Stricken Northern Kenya!](https://zandani.co.ke/article/stranded-up-north-journalist-secret-struggles-drought-stricken-northern-kenya).
