Right, gather 'round, because you won't believe the latest chinwag making the rounds! Turns out, while some are busy wringing their hands about a "reading crisis" in the country, others are having a right old row about what counts as a "proper" book. Honestly, you'd think we'd all be on the same page, but no!

## So, What's the Big Fuss About Books, Then?

The ongoing debate centers on the perceived value of fiction versus non-fiction. Some staunch readers argue that only non-fiction provides true intellectual benefit, dismissing fiction as mere entertainment. However, others strongly advocate for fiction, highlighting its crucial role in fostering critical thinking and empathy. Many experts and readers agree that both genres are essential for a well-rounded intellectual life.

### The Scoop: Are You Reading the 'Right' Books, Mate?

Honestly, some people just love a good argument, don't they? A recent chat brought up this absolute classic: the 'fiction versus non-fiction' showdown. Can you even imagine? Apparently, some rather serious types reckon that reading fiction is just a bit of a laugh, offering "little value beyond entertainment." (As if entertainment isn't important sometimes, eh?). This idea that non-fiction is somehow "smarter" than fiction is a perception some readers hold. They're the ones who'd probably turn their nose up at your latest romance novel, bless 'em.

### The Evidence: Cardiologists and Literary Legends!

Well, our intrepid reporter got right to the bottom of it, asking a leading cardiologist in Nairobi what he reads. And get this: the doctor declared he reads "solid books" and has "no time for stories!" (What a hoot!). He was "proud" of it, too! Honestly, the nerve! It seems many grown-ups share this rather stoic view, seeing fiction as a bit of a lightweight. But our columnist, bless her cotton socks, pointed out the sheer brilliance of authors like Chinua Achebe, Mariama Ba, Nawal el Saadawi, Ama Ata Aidoo, and Tsitsi Dangarembga. Imagine a world without *Things Fall Apart* or *Nervous Conditions*! What a nightmare!

She's even reading a bit of both herself - a hefty history tome, *The State of Africa* by Martin Meredith, alongside a cracking old novel, *Kosiya Kifefe* by Arthur Gakwandi, which apparently sheds light on Uganda's history through one character's life. Reading fiction, you see, can absolutely build critical thinking, while non-fiction sorts out your factual understanding. Both skills are massively important, if you ask us! And speaking of important things, did you know that [Kenyan Women Live Longer, But What's The Catch?](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/kenyan-women-longer-life-preventable-deaths) Talk about food for thought!

### The Verdict: Can't We All Just Get Along?

Honestly, the pressure to see everything in "binaries" is just tiresome, isn't it? Why compare? The reporter argued that the same brain can enjoy both, and that fiction helps with critical thinking while non-fiction builds factual understanding. While her debating partner initially thought she was just lucky to be reading a "useful" fiction book, he eventually conceded that some non-fiction can be a bit dodgy too. (Took him long enough!). The truth is, reading fiction can improve creativity, imagination, and empathy, while non-fiction expands general knowledge and critical thinking. So, it's not an either/or situation, chuck! Limiting yourself like that just stunts your intellectual growth. So, what's *your* take on this bookish brouhaha? Let us know!
