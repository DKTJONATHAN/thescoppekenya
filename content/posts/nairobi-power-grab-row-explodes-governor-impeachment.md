Right, gather 'round, because if you thought Nairobi's politics couldn't get more bonkers, you were dead wrong! Honestly, who saw *this* coming after the last disastrous "national government helps city" saga? Remember the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) back in 2020? Well, it only managed to gobble up a whopping Ksh27 billion ($209 million) of taxpayer money and then promptly left the county with a staggering Ksh15.5 billion ($120 million) in unpaid bills. And now, President William Ruto’s lot are having another go, barely six years later, with a brand-new "cooperation agreement" that's already got everyone up in arms!

## What's the Fuss About This New Nairobi Deal, Then?

This week, a cooperation agreement was signed between Kenya’s national government and Nairobi County, aiming to collaborate on transport, road infrastructure, solid waste management, water supply, sewerage, and public lighting. However, the deal, signed on February 17, 2026, has immediately sparked massive controversy, with critics alleging it's a cunning "power grab" by the national government over the city's affairs.

**The Scoop**
Well, mate, it seems like history is repeating itself in the most dramatic fashion! Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja is absolutely fuming, claiming "powerful individuals" in the national government are trying to muscle in on City Hall's turf, and he’s having none of it. Honestly, can you even imagine? Senator Edwin Sifuna chimed in, calling the Ksh80 billion ($620 million) agreement a "power grab through the backdoor," saying it'll make the Governor look like a "deputy governor" to the Prime Cabinet Secretary. And get this: the steering committee set up to oversee this whole shebang has 12 members, but two-thirds are national government appointees. Talk about stacked odds! It makes you wonder, doesn't it, what's *really* going on behind the scenes? Sometimes, you just need a bit of deep [context to understand the real story](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/ai-ndogo-context-ndiyo-mdosi-ukweli), if you catch my drift.

**The Evidence**
The ink on that deal was barely dry before a case was slapped down in court to try and nullify it. Though an initial court attempt to halt the agreement was reportedly refused, a new petition has been filed and is scheduled for a hearing in March 2026. But the real drama? Members of the city county assembly, bless 'em, have already started collecting signatures to impeach Governor Sakaja!. Honestly, they've reportedly got 55 signatures already, well over the 42 needed to even get the motion tabled. It seems they're fed up with "broken promises," "mismanagement of garbage," and stalled development projects, to name a few. This isn't the first time either, as there was another impeachment push against Sakaja in September 2025, which President Ruto and the late Raila Odinga apparently intervened to stop. Meanwhile, Sakaja himself is trying to play it cool, insisting they haven't "ceded any functions" and it's not a "transfer of functions". However, Principal Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, Charles Hinga, has a different take, saying "Nairobi is not a county but a capital city, so collaboration with the national government is inevitable," and even added, "This Nairobi is dysfunctional". What a mouthful! It all sounds a bit like a proper row, doesn't it? Some Members of Parliament are defending the pact, insisting it's about "cooperation and consultation" under Article 189 of the Constitution, not a "transfer of functions".

**The Verdict**
So, what's the long and short of it? It's a proper mess, isn't it? With claims of power grabs, court cases, and impeachment threats flying left, right, and centre, it looks like Nairobi's political scene is set for a truly explosive few weeks. Will the Governor hold on, or will the national government finally get its claws fully into City Hall? Only time will tell, mate. But you can bet your bottom dollar we'll be watching!
