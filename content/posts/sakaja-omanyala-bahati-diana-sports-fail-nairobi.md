## Nairobi "International" Standards or Just International Dust?
Imagine! We are in February 2026, and Johnson Sakaja is still out here giving us "Vibes and InshaAllah" instead of actual world-class sports facilities. This week’s "Nairobi Sports Festival" was supposed to be a showcase of talent, but instead, it looked like a high-budget episode of *Real Housewives of Nairobi* gone wrong. 

Sasa basi, our very own Ferdinand Omanyala showed up ready to break records, but how do you break records on a track that looks like it was paved with good intentions and leftover gravel from a road project in Githurai? Omanyala is a national treasure, a literal human Ferrari, yet Sakaja had him running in what can only be described as a construction site with VIP seating. Kwani? Is this the "City of Order and Dignity" or the City of Dust and Delusion? 

## The Bahatis: Who Invited the Clout-Chasers?
Just when we thought the embarrassment couldn't get worse, enter Bahati and Diana Marua. Wueh! Someone please tell me what a gospel-singer-turned-rapper-turned-politician-wannabe is doing on a professional sprinting track. The way Bahati was stretching, you’d think he was preparing to outrun his mounting debt, but instead, he and Diana decided to turn the 100m heats into a TikTok dance set. 

Character Development is real, because Diana Marua actually tried to "race" in a designer outfit that cost more than the prize money for the actual athletes. The "Tea" is that the crowd wasn't even cheering; they were laughing. While Omanyala was trying to maintain a professional face, you could see the "Why am I here?" look in his eyes. It’s a sports event, not a reality TV audition!

## Sakaja, Fix the Math!
The math is simply not mathing. Sakaja spends half the budget on PR photographers to make the stadium look like it’s in Zurich, but the moment the cameras stop clicking, you realize there’s no running water in the locker rooms. Omanyala deserves better than being used as a prop for Sakaja’s 2027 re-election campaign. 

And for Bahati and Diana? Please, stay in the studio (or wherever it is you go to make those songs we didn't ask for). Leave the tracks to the professionals. We are tired of sports being treated like a side-show for influencers who can't even run a kilometer without needing a "lifestyle vlog" break. This week was a total mess—low-quality tracks, high-quality cringe, and a Governor who thinks a smile fixes a broken stadium. Trash!
