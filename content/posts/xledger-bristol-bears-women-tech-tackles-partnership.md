## Xledger Bristol Bears Women Partnership Kicks Off

Right, so while the Bath Rugby U18s managed to pip Bristol Bears U18s in an absolute thriller recently (36-38, talk about a nail-biter!), the real buzz around Bristol rugby, especially for the 2025/26 season, has to be the expanded partnership between Xledger UK and the Bristol Bears Women. This isn't just another logo on a shirt, mate; it’s a proper commitment to powering women’s sport and the community. Xledger, a leader in cloud finance software, has stepped up as Principal Partner and front-of-shirt sponsor, extending a relationship that's been building since 2019.

### More Than Just a Shirt Sponsor, Mate!

Honestly, it’s brilliant to see. Xledger isn't just slapping their name on the jerseys; they're getting stuck in. They're sponsoring two of the Red Roses' finest, Abbie Ward and Hannah Botterman, both World Cup training squad members. That's a real vote of confidence in individual talent, isn't it? But it goes even further than that. The partnership also includes the Bristol Bears Community Foundation’s 'Bear in Mind' programme. This 12-week initiative is a fantastic shout, helping 14-16-year-old girls navigate the challenges of growing up through classroom and practical rugby sessions. It’s about building resilience, confidence, and personal values - proper good stuff, that.

### A Winning Scrum for Women's Sport

And let's not forget, the timing couldn't be better, could it? With the Women’s Rugby World Cup having been in England in 2025, and Ashton Gate in Bristol hosting both quarter-finals and semi-finals, the spotlight has been firmly on women’s rugby. The excitement around the sport is palpable, an "absolute madness" of talent and passion, much like what we saw in the DHL Super Rugby Pacific. This partnership is a clear sign that big businesses are recognising the value and potential in backing female athletes and grassroots development. Xledger’s commitment to female empowerment, particularly with over half their workforce being women (a unique stat for the tech sector!), really makes this feel like a natural fit.

### Tech Giants Backing the Game

It’s genuinely refreshing to see a true-cloud finance software leader like Xledger, with operations in over 60 countries, putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to Corporate Social Responsibility. Their long-standing relationship with Bristol Sport and the expansion of this particular partnership highlight a belief in the values of respect, resilience, and progress - things that are absolutely vital, both on the pitch and in the boardroom. This isn't just about financial solutions; it’s about nurturing talent and creating opportunities, proving that when tech and sport team up, it can be a real game-changer for the community.
