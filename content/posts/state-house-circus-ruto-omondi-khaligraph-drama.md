## The Audacity of the Gava
Wueh! Imagine the nerves of this government! Just when we thought we’d seen it all with the taxes, William Ruto decided to host a "Creative Economy Gala" at State House this past Tuesday. Kwani they think we have amnesia? While the common mwananchi is out here battling a shilling that’s doing gymnastics, Zakayo is busy feeding influencers pilau. The hypocrisy is screaming, honey! And don't even get me started on Rigathi Gachagua, who spent half the night trying to convince us that the "Mountain" is happy while people are literally eating stones. Sasa basi, the drama didn't even start with the politicians; it started with the people we actually thought had backbones.

## Eric Omondi vs. The OG: A Messy Affair
The real tea spilled when Khaligraph Jones decided to show up and perform like a good little boy. The OG? More like the Obedient Guest! Khaligraph was out there rapping about "hustling" while standing next to the people making the hustle impossible. Eric Omondi, our resident activist-in-chief, didn't waste a second. He went straight to Instagram Live to call out Khaligraph for "selling his soul for a plate of rice and a handshake." Eric was literally shaking with rage, calling the performers "state house projects." Imagine the character development! From a comedian who used to wear diapers to the only guy with the balls to tell Ruto to his face that the country is bleeding. 

## Khaligraph’s Weak Comeback
Khaligraph tried to clap back, telling Eric to "stick to comedy and leave the business to the big boys." Business? Kwani taking crumbs from the high table is now a corporate strategy? The comments section was a warzone. Fans are tired, and the sentiment is clear: you can’t claim to be the voice of the streets while you’re busy massaging the egos of the oppressors. Khaligraph, you’ve been downgraded from "OG" to "Office Girl" of the State House. Deal with it!

## Raila’s Cryptic Shade
And where was the Enigma during all this? Raila Odinga, as usual, waited for the dust to settle before dropping a cryptic tweet about "wolves in sheep's clothing." Baba is just sitting back with his popcorn watching the Kenya Kwanza house burn from the inside. He didn't have to say much, but the timing was surgical. While Ruto is trying to buy the youth through Eric Omondi’s peers, Raila is reminding everyone that a gilded cage is still a cage. 

## The Verdict: No More Vibes and Inshallah
Listen, it’s 2026. We are not the same naive lot from four years ago. If you’re a celebrity and you think you can dine with the people making our lives a living hell and then come back to ask us for "views" and "support," you’re dreaming. Eric Omondi might be extra, but at least he’s not a puppet. As for Khaligraph, we see you, and we’ve archived the betrayal. The tea is hot, the people are angry, and State House is just a fancy clubhouse for people who have lost touch with reality. Stay woke, because these guys will sell you for a TikTok trend!
