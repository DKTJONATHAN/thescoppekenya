## The City is Sinking but the "Vibe" is Mandatory
Imagine being a Nairobian in February 2026. The drainage system is a myth, the potholes have become lakes, but our "Super-Governor" Johnson Sakaja is busy hosting the "Nairobi Speed Fest" at Uhuru Park. Kwani we eat vibes? Sakaja spent the whole week posing for photos like a lifestyle influencer instead of fixing the mess in the CBD. The PR is top-tier, but the ground is very different. This man is more concerned with his dimples and TikTok transitions than the actual garbage piling up in Eastlands. Character development is hitting Nairobians hard!

## Omanyala, Why Are You Part of This Circus?
Our boy Ferdinand Omanyala, the fastest man in Africa, was brought in as the "Guest of Honor." But instead of a professional sporting event, we got a chaotic circus that started five hours late. Sasa basi, why is a world-class athlete being used to sanitize a political flop? Omanyala, stick to the track and leave these PR stunts to the clout-chasers. Seeing him standing there awkwardly while the sound system failed for the tenth time was the definition of second-hand embarrassment. You’re a champion, Ferdinand—don't let these people turn you into a "Githeri Man" of 2026.

## The Audacity of the Bahatis
And then there’s the dynamic duo of clout—Bahati and Diana Marua. These two never miss an opportunity to make everything about them. Diana decided to "bless" us with a performance that sounded like a generator failing in the middle of the night. Imagine the audacity! While Bahati was busy filming his never-ending reality show, the crowd was literally booing Diana off the stage. Tea is, they reportedly demanded a 2-million-shilling appearance fee for that noise. Sakaja, is this where our taxes are going? To fund the "Mount Kenya" ego of a man who still thinks he can sing?

## The Bottom Line: Total Failure
This week has shown us one thing: Nairobi is a movie, and the directors are absolutely clueless. Between Sakaja’s photoshoot sessions, Omanyala’s misplaced presence, and Diana Marua’s "music," we are finished as a county. If this is the "Future of Nairobi" we were promised, then we might as well just relocate to the village. Wueh! The tea is too hot today, but someone had to say it. Stop the clout, fix the city!
