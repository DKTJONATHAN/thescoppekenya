## Arsenal vs Chelsea: The Super Sunday Showdown

This Super Sunday in the English Premier League brings forth a defining London Derby as log leaders Arsenal host Chelsea at the iconic Emirates Stadium. Kick-off is scheduled for 19:30 (EAT) in a fixture that could significantly impact both the title race and the battle for Champions League qualification.

### Unpacking the Arsenal vs Chelsea Match Preview

Arsenal, the Gunners, currently command the top spot in the Premier League table with an impressive 61 points from 28 matches. Their form has been formidable, remaining unbeaten in their last six matches across all competitions, securing four wins and two draws. This run has seen them score an average of 2.5 goals per game while conceding a mere 0.67. Their recent 4-1 demolition of Tottenham Hotspur showcased their attacking prowess, despite occasional defensive lapses seen in draws against Wolves (2-2) and Brentford (1-1). At home, Arsenal have been a force, winning four consecutive league games and accumulating 32 points from 13 matches (W10, D2, L1). They also boast the league's best home defensive record, having conceded just eight goals at the Emirates. Arsenal averages 2.75 goals per league game this season, with 54% of their matches exceeding 2.5 goals.

Chelsea, the Blues, arrive in decent form, having suffered only one defeat in their last 10 matches across all competitions. In their previous six outings, they have registered three wins, two draws, and one loss, averaging 2.17 goals scored and 1.17 conceded. A recent 1-1 draw with Burnley proved frustrating after conceding a late equaliser. Away from home, Chelsea hold the second-best record in the division (W6 D4 L3) and have scored 25 league goals on the road, a joint-league high. However, their defensive vulnerabilities away from home are evident, with just one clean sheet kept in their last six away matches.

### Crucial Team News Ahead of Arsenal vs Chelsea

For Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, the team news is largely positive. Star player Bukayo Saka is expected to be fit despite a recent scare, and Ben White could also make a return to the squad. However, the Gunners will be without Kai Havertz, Mikel Merino, and Max Dowman, who all remain sidelined. In terms of attacking threats, Viktor Gyokeres is in electric form, having scored eight goals in 2026 so far, while Eberechi Eze has developed a knack for delivering in London derbies.

Chelsea faces some defensive stability concerns due to injuries and suspensions. Wesley Fofana is suspended, while Marc Cucurella and Levi Colwill are both out of contention. On the offensive front, Joao Pedro is a key attacking threat, boasting nine goal contributions in his last six league games. Cole Palmer, with four goals in his last three league appearances, is expected to start and will be a player to watch.

### Head-to-Head and Our Arsenal vs Chelsea Prediction

In recent head-to-head encounters, Arsenal have asserted their dominance, winning four of the last six clashes, with two draws and no defeats. The average total goals in these matches stands at 2.67, and both teams have found the back of the net in 50% of them.

Considering Arsenal's consistent attacking performance at home and Chelsea's strong offensive metrics coupled with their defensive absences, the "both teams to score" (BTTS) market emerges as the standout selection. While Arsenal may ultimately secure the victory, the data strongly supports BTTS as the best-value prediction for this thrilling London Derby.
