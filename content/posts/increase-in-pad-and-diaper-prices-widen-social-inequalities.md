## The Unintended Consequences of Increased Pad and Diaper Prices

The National Environment Management Authority's (Nema) Sustainable Waste Management (Extended Producer Responsibility) Regulations, 2024, which came into full effect on February 3, 2026, have led to a significant increase in the cost of essential hygiene products. This regulatory shift, intended to promote environmental responsibility, is now widely expected to increase pad and diaper prices by over 20 percent, directly impacting low-income households and threatening to widen social inequalities across Kenya.

The implementation of these regulations mandates that manufacturers and importers bear the cost of managing their products' entire lifecycle, including post-consumer waste. While the environmental intentions are commendable, the practical outcome has seen these additional operational expenses, including a Sh150 fee per imported item and various registration and licensing costs, passed directly to the consumer. For instance, a 14-pack of sanitary pads is projected to rise from an average of Sh218 to Sh261, and a jumbo pack of 60 diapers could increase from Sh2,000 to Sh2,553, potentially adding an extra Sh23,000 annually for families with infants. This is not merely an inconvenience; it is a looming crisis for millions of Kenyans already grappling with strained budgets.

### How Increased Prices Will Widen Social Inequalities

The impact of these increased pad and diaper prices extends far beyond a simple rise in household expenditure; it directly threatens to widen social inequalities that are already deeply entrenched. Access to basic menstrual hygiene products remains a critical challenge for many women and girls in Kenya, with a 2024 report indicating that 65 percent cannot afford sanitary pads. This financial barrier often forces girls to miss school, impacting their academic performance and future opportunities, and increasing the risk of infections from resorting to unsafe alternatives. Can we truly advance as a nation when a fundamental biological process becomes a punitive economic burden?

For children, the rising cost of diapers translates into fewer clean changes, directly affecting their comfort, health, and early childhood development. Wealthier families may absorb these costs without significant hardship, but for low-income households, these essential items become luxuries. This disproportionate burden risks deepening the chasm between the privileged and the vulnerable, exacerbating existing disparities in health outcomes, educational attainment, and overall quality of life. The very fabric of our society is tested when basic human dignity becomes contingent on economic standing.

### A Balanced Approach to Mitigate Widening Social Inequalities

Addressing this challenge demands a balanced approach that simultaneously safeguards our environment and protects the most vulnerable consumers from the repercussions of increased pad and diaper prices. Policy interventions are urgently needed to ensure that environmental responsibility does not inadvertently penalise women and children. Could Nema and manufacturers collaborate more effectively to promote cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives, such as biodegradable sanitary products, perhaps supported by subsidies or tax relief to make them genuinely affordable?.

Public awareness campaigns are also crucial, not only to educate consumers on the purpose of Nema's regulations and safe disposal methods but also to promote reusable options and proper waste management practices without incurring extra costs. We have seen the power of collaborative efforts in other sectors; for instance, the recent launch of a landmark guide on the [conservation of African livestock genetic resources by AABNet and partners](https://zandani.co.ke/article/aabnet-and-partners-conservation-of-african-livestock-genetic-resources-guide) demonstrates how multi-stakeholder partnerships can secure Africa's agricultural future through proactive, sustainable strategies. A similar spirit of partnership between government, NGOs, and the private sector is essential here to provide targeted support, such as free or subsidised sanitary towels through schools or community centres, mirroring existing menstrual hygiene programmes.

Ultimately, our goal must be dual protection: safeguarding the environment through responsible waste management while ensuring that access to essential hygiene products is not a source of financial strain for Kenyan women and children. To ignore either side is to risk public health setbacks and to allow social inequalities to widen further. The current situation, marked by increased pad and diaper prices, highlights the urgent need for collaborative, practical, equitable, and sustainable solutions that truly serve both our planet and our people.
