## Lisa Rinna Says Soap Costar Was 'Biggest Bully in Hollywood'

Lisa Rinna has unleashed a bombshell in her new memoir, "You Better Believe I'm Gonna Talk About It," alleging that her former "Days of Our Lives" costar, Robert Kelker-Kelly, was the "biggest bully in Hollywood." The book, published this week, details the actress's challenging experiences on the soap opera set in the 1990s.

### Unpacking Rinna's 'Biggest Bully in Hollywood' Allegations

The entertainment world is buzzing after Lisa Rinna, known for her candid personality, dropped a major revelation about her time on "Days of Our Lives." In her recently released memoir, "You Better Believe I'm Gonna Talk About It," Rinna explicitly names Robert Kelker-Kelly, who played Bo Brady opposite her Billie Reed, as a significant source of stress. Their on-screen romance was a stark contrast to their real-life dynamic, which Rinna describes as "strictly for the camera."

Rinna's account paints a vivid picture of a difficult working relationship. She alleges that Kelker-Kelly would employ the silent treatment if she didn't comply with his wishes, creating an unpredictable and exhausting environment. "He was a ticking time bomb," Rinna writes, adding that she never knew if she would encounter "nice Robert Kelker-Kelly or dark Robert Kelker-Kelly" each morning on set.

### The 'Days of Our Lives' Drama: A Soap Costar's Dark Side

The allegations extend beyond mere disagreement. Rinna claims Kelker-Kelly "made my life a living hell on the set of Days" and was "horrible" to her. She further describes his behavior as "passive-aggressive, manipulative and played weird mind games." These claims highlight the intense pressures and personal conflicts that can simmer beneath the surface of seemingly glamorous productions. Both Rinna and Kelker-Kelly were part of "Days of Our Lives" from 1992 to 1995, a period Rinna now reveals was fraught with tension.

### Confronting the 'Biggest Bully in Hollywood' - Rinna's Reflections

Rinna doesn't shy away from drawing parallels to her more recent reality TV experiences. Referencing a past comment by Kathy Hilton, who called Rinna the "biggest bully in Hollywood," Rinna retorts that it's "Not true. Not even close!" She asserts that she has "legit stories about the real bullies in this town," with Kelker-Kelly being one of them.

The memoir also touches on Rinna's attempts to make amends with people she discusses in the book, acknowledging that some amends are simply not possible. This candid reflection speaks volumes about the lasting impact of such experiences. While Entertainment Weekly has reached out to Robert Kelker-Kelly for comment on Rinna's remarks, a representative for "Days of Our Lives" has declined to comment.

### Za Ndani's Take: The Impact of Rinna's Memoir

Lisa Rinna's memoir isn't just a tell-all; it's a powerful statement on accountability and the hidden dynamics within the entertainment industry. Her willingness to share such personal and challenging experiences sheds light on the often-unseen struggles behind the scenes. It's a reminder that even in the dazzling world of Hollywood, personal rivalries can be as intense as any high-stakes competition, much like the fierce battles we see in the [Champions League Race: Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool Fixtures - The Premier League Battle Heats Up](https://zandani.co.ke/article/champions-league-race-manchester-united-chelsea-liverpool-fixtures). Za Ndani will be keenly watching for any further developments from this unfolding story.
