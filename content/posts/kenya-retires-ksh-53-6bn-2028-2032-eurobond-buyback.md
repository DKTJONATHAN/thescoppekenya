## Kenya Retires KSh 53.6Bn in Strategic Eurobond Buyback

The Government of Kenya has successfully retired US$415.4 million (KSh 53.6 billion) of its 2028 and 2032 Eurobonds through a tender offer. This proactive measure aims to manage external debt, reduce rollover risk, and optimise the nation's maturity profile following a recent dual-tranche Eurobond issuance.

### Details of the 2028 and 2032 Eurobond Buyback Operation

Kenya's Treasury accepted US$415.4 million (KSh 53.6 billion) of its outstanding external debt through the tender offer, as published via the London Stock Exchange. The transaction involved the full acceptance of all 2028 notes tendered and a partial acceptance of the 2032 notes. Specifically, US$324.8 million (KSh 41.9 billion) of the 2032 notes were accepted, applying a final proration factor of 0.329471. The Republic will compensate investors at US$1,035 per US$1,000 of principal for the 2028 notes and US$1,055 per US$1,000 for the 2032 notes, equivalent to 103.50% and 105.50% of face value respectively, plus accrued interest. Settlement is scheduled for March 3, after which all repurchased bonds will be cancelled and permanently retired.

### Funding the Eurobond Buyback and Extended Maturity Profile

The successful execution of this tender offer was funded by Kenya's US$2.25 billion (KSh 290.3 billion) dual-tranche Eurobond issuance earlier this month, which removed the financing condition previously attached to the buyback. This refinancing package comprised US$900 million of seven-year notes due 2034, priced at a 7.875% coupon, and US$1.35 billion of 12-year notes due 2039, priced at 8.700%. Both tranches are structured to amortise in three equal instalments, a mechanism designed to extend Kenya's maturity profile and mitigate exposure to substantial single bullet repayments. This strategy is critical for long-term fiscal stability.

### Strategic Implications of the Eurobond Buyback

Treasury officials have characterised this operation as a proactive management of Kenya’s external debt, specifically targeting rollover risk associated with the 2028 maturity and addressing amortisation pressure from the 2032 notes. The transaction follows a significant positive development in Kenya's sovereign risk profile. Moody’s Ratings upgraded Kenya's sovereign credit rating to B3 from Caa1 with a stable outlook on January 27, 2026. This upgrade cited lower near-term default risk and stronger external buffers, a sentiment reinforced by improved foreign exchange reserves and a narrowed current account deficit.

Kenya's economy is projected to grow by 5.3 percent in 2026, supported by factors such as low inflation, easing financial conditions, recovering domestic demand, and improved agricultural output. The nation's external position has also strengthened, with official foreign exchange reserves standing at Ksh 1.56 trillion by December 2025, covering 5.2 months of imports. While the government focuses on managing external financial obligations, the domestic economy continues to exhibit diverse areas of financial engagement. For example, the competitive gaming sector is seeing increased prize pools, as evidenced by [Kenyan PUBG MOBILE Players Invited to Road to 2026 PMGO Africa - Competing for a KSh 1.3 Million Prize Pool](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenyan-pubg-mobile-players-road-to-2026-pmgo-africa-ksh-1-3-million-prize-pool). This Eurobond buyback, coupled with the new issuance, underscores Kenya's commitment to prudent fiscal management and enhancing investor confidence in its long-term economic trajectory.
