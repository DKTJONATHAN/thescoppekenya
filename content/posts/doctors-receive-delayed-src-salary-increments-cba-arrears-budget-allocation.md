## Doctors Receive Delayed SRC Salary Increments and CBA Arrears

Kenyan doctors are finally set to receive long-awaited salary increments and pending Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) arrears, a development poised to resolve protracted remuneration disputes. This significant progress follows a crucial budget allocation and sustained pressure from the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU).

The resolution encompasses the implementation of the 3rd and 4th Remuneration Review Cycles, alongside adjustments stemming from the 2017-2024 CBA, which had faced months of delays leading to industrial action. The government has committed to implementing salary adjustments and paying arrears, with full implementation anticipated by mid-February 2026.

### Unpacking the Delayed SRC Salary Increments

The Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) review cycles have been a central point of contention for medical professionals. County governments initially failed to implement the 3rd Remuneration Review Cycle, covering the 2021/22-2024/25 period, citing funding constraints within the Equitable Share allocation. However, following the allocation of Ksh2 billion within the Equitable Share specifically for personal emoluments, counties have commenced rolling out this pending review cycle. This means doctors under county governments will receive payments in arrears, as the third cycle was due in the 2024/2025 financial year. Counties are presently integrating these adjustments into their supplementary budgets to align payrolls with the updated SRC salary scales.

At the national level, the Ministry of Health has already processed payments for the 3rd cycle.

### Resolution on CBA Arrears

In addition to the SRC review cycles, doctors are also slated to receive long-pending basic salary adjustments under the 2017-2024 Collective Bargaining Agreement, which had been delayed for months and instigated industrial action. The government confirmed the release of funds for these CBA adjustments, and the payroll system has been modified to ensure accurate salary calculations. KMPDU continues to collaborate with government agencies to rectify any errors identified in earlier salary calculations, aiming for precise compensation for every doctor.

Arrears for Ministry of Health doctors’ basic salaries and call allowances have been provisioned in a supplementary budget, with payment planned for the 2025/2026 financial year. Furthermore, arrears related to the 2024/2025 CBA have been incorporated into the supplementary budget and are expected to be disbursed within the current financial year.

### The Role of Budget Allocation

A significant boost to these payments comes from recent budgetary revisions. Kenya's 2025/26 budget has been adjusted through the first supplementary estimates, reflecting increased expenditure pressures in key sectors, including public sector wages. This revised budget, announced in the latest Budget Policy Statement on February 25, 2026, accommodates revenue shortfalls and allocates funds to address critical needs. The Ksh2 billion allocation to counties for the 3rd Remuneration Review Cycle underscores the government's commitment to resolving these financial obligations.

### The Fourth SRC Review Cycle: Awaiting Full Implementation

While the 3rd Remuneration Review Cycle is being rolled out, the status of the 4th Remuneration Review Cycle, covering 2025 to 2029, presents a mixed picture. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission approved a pay rise for national government civil servants, marking the first phase of this cycle, effective retrospectively from July 1, 2025. This review is projected to cost the Exchequer Ksh2.06 billion in the 2025/2026 financial year. While the Ministry of Health at the national level is working towards implementing the 4th cycle, KMPDU has noted that the SRC is yet to issue official implementation guidelines for doctors, awaiting formal instructions.

### County-Level Challenges Despite National Budget Allocation

Despite these national pronouncements and budget allocations, localised challenges persist. KMPDU Secretary General Davji Atellah had, in a letter dated January 20, 2026, confirmed the government's agreement to implement salary adjustments and arrears from July 2025, rejecting any further rounds of multi-agency negotiations. However, as recently as February 24, 2026, Mombasa County doctors, under KMPDU, issued a seven-day strike notice, threatening industrial action from March 3 due to unresolved labour grievances, unpaid dues, and other issues at the county level. This highlights that while policy and funding decisions are made centrally, their complete and uniform implementation across all county governments remains a critical area requiring vigilant oversight.

As the medical fraternity secures critical financial resolutions, the nation's cultural landscape also continues to evolve, with figures like Tiwa Savage making strides with initiatives such as her [Afrobeats Music Foundation in Africa](https://zandani.co.ke/article/tiwa-savage-afrobeats-music-foundation-africa-berklee-dream). The ongoing efforts to address doctors' remuneration signify a pivotal moment for Kenya's public healthcare sector, albeit with ongoing monitoring required to ensure full compliance and stability.
