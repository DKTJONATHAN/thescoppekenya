## DCI Accuses Linda Wananchi Politicians Over Supporter’s Death and Arming Followers

The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has formally accused organisers of the Linda Mwananchi rally of arming their supporters, following the death of one individual during a political event in Mbale, Vihiga County. This serious allegation comes amid escalating political tensions surrounding public gatherings.

### Allegations of Arming Followers and Constitutional Breaches

In a statement issued on Sunday, February 22, 2026, the DCI asserted that preliminary investigations revealed the organisers of the Linda Mwananchi rally permitted their supporters to carry weapons into the Kakamega event, a clear contravention of constitutional requirements for peaceful assembly. The DCI's statement underscored that the right to assemble is explicitly conditioned on participants remaining peaceful and unarmed, as stipulated in Article 37 of the Constitution. The agency firmly insisted that all political rally organisers must ensure their supporters remain unarmed and conduct proceedings peacefully to prevent violence and uphold public order.

### The Second Supporter’s Death

The DCI's accusations followed the death of George Olande Otobe, a boda boda rider from Kisumu County, who died on Saturday, February 21, 2026, in Mbale town, Vihiga County. Preliminary reports indicate that Otobe allegedly stabbed another supporter, Hussein Hassan, in the head during a confrontation, leading to fatal retaliation from bystanders. A knife believed to have been used in the initial attack was recovered at the scene. Otobe's body was initially taken to Vihiga Referral Hospital before being transferred to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary for preservation and postmortem, which confirmed severe head injuries consistent with mob violence.

This incident marks the second fatality linked to the Linda Mwananchi tour, following the death of another supporter, Vincent Ayomo, in Kitengela a week earlier on February 15, 2026, from a single gunshot wound. The recurring violence at political gatherings raises significant concerns about the rule of law and the safety of citizens attending such events.

### Political Reactions and Counter-Accusations on Arming Followers

In the wake of Otobe's death, Democracy for Citizens Party (DCP) leader Rigathi Gachagua took to social media, alleging that the deceased was a "state-sponsored goon" from Kisumu. Gachagua further accused the Ministry of Interior of orchestrating intimidation against the opposition through such sponsored individuals, claiming government officials mobilised goons with police escort to unleash violence.

Separately, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino claimed that police officers assigned to his security detail were arrested in Kisumu on Saturday evening and remained in custody without stated charges. Owino has also accused authorities of deflecting responsibility concerning tear gas incidents, asserting the state's sole control over such equipment. He previously alleged that his brother-in-law was arrested as a form of intimidation ahead of the Kakamega rally and that groups were being mobilised from Kisumu to cause chaos. These allegations contribute to a tense political environment where blame is exchanged between political factions and state agencies.

The ongoing investigations by the DCI aim to bring all culpable individuals to book, whether for mob violence or for arming supporters. The recurring incidents of violence at political rallies highlight a critical challenge to peaceful political discourse in the country. Such events often overshadow critical discussions on governance and accountability, reminiscent of the broader issues impacting national progress.

The DCI has reiterated its commitment to upholding justice and maintaining public safety amidst these volatile political activities.
