## Spiro Secures US$50mn to Fuel African Battery-Swapping Network Expansion

Spiro, a prominent pan-African electric mobility enterprise, has successfully raised US$50 million in debt financing to significantly expand its battery-swapping infrastructure and electric vehicle operations across the continent. This strategic capital injection is poised to accelerate Africa's transition to sustainable transportation solutions.

### Strategic Investment Bolsters Spiro's Battery-Swapping Network

The US$50mn debt financing was secured from a consortium of key financial institutions: Afreximbank, Nithio, and the Africa Go Green Fund. This funding reinforces Spiro's position as Africa's largest electric mobility company, operating the continent's most extensive network of battery-swapping for electric two-wheel vehicles across seven countries, including Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and Rwanda. Spiro, a Series D company founded in 2019, previously secured a significant US$100 million investment in October 2025, bringing its total recent funding to US$150 million within five months.

Kaushik Burman, CEO of Spiro, articulated the company's ambitious vision, stating, “With strong financial backing and cutting-cutting technology, Spiro is leading Africa's transition to sustainable mobility. This new funding reinforces our vision of building a robust, scalable energy network tailored for Africa by Africans.” This capital will be deployed to extend Spiro’s network into new markets, advance automated battery-swap and fast-charging technology, and integrate renewable energy solutions. Spiro maintains regional production and assembly facilities in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and Rwanda.

### The Role of Financial Partners in Expanding the Battery-Swapping Network

The financing partners bring substantial expertise and commitment to green initiatives. Afreximbank, a key player in African trade finance, is set to double its intra-African trade financing to US$40 billion by 2026, demonstrating its broader commitment to continental economic development. The bank reported a record net income of US$973.5 million in 2024, highlighting its robust financial capacity.

Nithio, a climate fintech platform, leverages AI-driven analytics to channel capital towards clean-energy companies and climate resilience initiatives. Nithio recently expanded its portfolio with Spiro in January 2026 and launched its Fund for Universal Energy Lending (FUEL) in February 2026, targeting e-mobility among other renewable technologies. Laurène Aigrain, Managing Director of Africa Go Green Fund, remarked, “Spiro has built a strong platform that is delivering tangible impact across multiple African markets; we are pleased to support the next phase of its growth as it scales critical clean mobility infrastructure.” Africa Go Green Fund, managed by Cygnum Capital, focuses on financing industrial energy efficiency, green transport, and projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The fund received a €30 million loan from DEG in January 2026 to further expand its climate-focused financing across Africa.

### Spiro's Impact and Alignment with Kenya's Green Mobility Goals

Spiro's operations have already demonstrated significant environmental and economic impact. The company has deployed over 80,000 electric motorcycles, established more than 2,500 battery swapping stations, and completed over 30 million battery swaps, contributing to more than 1 billion kilometers of low-carbon emissions travel. This innovative battery-swapping model allows riders to quickly replace depleted batteries, reducing downtime and ensuring consistent energy access.

The expansion of Spiro's battery-swapping network aligns strategically with Kenya's recently launched National Electric Mobility Policy, presented on February 3, 2026. This policy explicitly identifies electric two-wheelers as a leading segment in Kenya's early transition to electric vehicles, with electric motorcycle registrations seeing substantial growth. As Kenya continues to advance its economic and sustainable development agenda, mirroring the dynamism seen in other sectors, such as the confirmed Harambee Stars matches for the [FIFA Series 2026 Explained: Harambee Stars Matches Confirmed for Global Showcase](https://zandani.co.ke/article/fifa-series-2026-explained-harambee-stars-matches), investments in green mobility infrastructure are critical. Spiro’s commitment to delivering electric vehicles made in Africa by Africans for Africa further underscores its role in the continent's sustainable future.
