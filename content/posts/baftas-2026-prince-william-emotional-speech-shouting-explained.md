## BAFTAs 2026: Prince William's Emotional Speech & The Real Story Behind the Shouts!

The "shouting" at the BAFTAs 2026 actually refers to a couple of things, mate! Firstly, it's about the deeply impactful film "I Swear," which highlights Tourette syndrome and won big for Robert Aramayo. There was even a moment where a man with Tourette's reportedly shouted a swearword at Paddington Bear - honestly, you couldn't make it up!. Plus, Prince William himself admitted he wasn't in a "calm state" before his own emotional speech, hinting at the high emotions of the night.

Right, so the 79th EE BAFTA Film Awards, what a night for glitz and gossip, eh? Our very own Prince William and Princess Catherine graced the red carpet, looking ever so regal, even after William's uncle Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was reportedly arrested just days before. Talk about keeping a stiff upper lip! They even had an awkward moment dodging a heckler, bless them. But the real buzz? William delivered an absolutely emotional speech when presenting Dame Donna Langley with the BAFTA Fellowship Award. He spoke so passionately about her "exceptional" contribution to film, despite admitting he wasn't feeling "calm" himself. Honestly, you could feel the raw emotion from him!

### BAFTAs 2026 Royal Reactions: What William *Really* Thought of the Films!

Now, while William was all smiles for the cameras, we hear he had some rather candid thoughts backstage about the nominated films! He apparently described 'Sinners' as "a bit dark" and 'One Battle After Another' (which swept the board, mind you!) as "weird". But he *loved* 'F1', calling it "fantastic… primarily due to the music." Can you even imagine the royal critique? Kate, on the other hand, *did* manage to watch 'Hamnet' - William was saving it for a "calm state" (what a nightmare, too much royal drama!) - and she ended up with "very puffy eyes." What a powerful film it must be to get a royal teary!

### BAFTAs 2026 Red Carpet Shouts: Fashion Fails & Fabulosity!

And the fashion, oh the fashion! The red carpet was, as always, a parade of looks. Princess Catherine looked absolutely stunning in a flowing pink gown. Kylie Jenner turned up with Timothée Chalamet, apparently sneaking in to avoid stealing his spotlight - or perhaps to avoid *more* Jammie Dodger jokes from host Alan Cumming! (What an X-rated gag, honestly, Kylie looked squirming!) Speaking of Alan, he got quite a mixed reaction from viewers, with many demanding David Tennant be brought back! "This is awful!" some folks were shouting on social media.

### BAFTAs 2026 Backstage Whispers: Snubs and Surprises!

The night had its share of upsets, too! Robert Aramayo snatching Best Leading Actor from Hollywood heavyweights like Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet was a genuine shocker for his role as Tourette syndrome campaigner John Davidson in 'I Swear'. Apparently, Ethan Hawke was ever so gracious backstage, congratulating him heartily. But honestly, the biggest "shout" of discontent came from viewers at home when the 'In Memoriam' segment missed out on some huge stars like James Van Der Beek and Eric Dane, who sadly passed away recently. You'd think they'd double-check that list, wouldn't you? What a oversight!
