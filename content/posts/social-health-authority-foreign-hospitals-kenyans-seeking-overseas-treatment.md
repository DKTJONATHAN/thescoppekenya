## Social Health Authority Paves Way for Kenyans Seeking Overseas Treatment

The Social Health Authority (SHA) has officially approved eight foreign hospitals, located in India, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, providing a crucial pathway for Kenyans seeking specialised medical treatment abroad under its new overseas care package. This initiative, set to commence next week, marks a significant reform in the nation's healthcare accessibility, aiming to ensure life-saving procedures are available even when local facilities cannot provide them.

### Rigorous Framework for Foreign Hospitals and Overseas Treatment

Dr. Mercy Mwangangi, the Chief Executive Officer of the Social Health Authority, has outlined a stringent referral process designed to ensure transparency and accountability in accessing overseas treatment. Patients must first undergo assessment at a recognised healthcare facility within Kenya, where a doctor determines the necessity for specialised treatment abroad and issues a formal referral to one of the SHA-approved hospitals. The referral note is then submitted to the SHA, and the selected overseas hospital logs an electronic admission request. The Authority subsequently verifies the patient's active and paid-up membership before authorising treatment.

This structured approach aims to mitigate previous challenges, including widespread fraud identified under the defunct National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which the SHA replaced in October 2024. The maximum coverage for overseas treatment is capped at KSh 500,000 per patient, a figure subject to review following negotiations with accredited international providers. An initial list of 36 specific medical services, identified by the Benefits Package and Tariffs Advisory Panel as unavailable locally, will be covered under this framework.

### Enhancing Access to Specialised Care for Kenyans Seeking Overseas Treatment

The introduction of this overseas care package is a critical step towards fulfilling the promise of universal health coverage. While the approval of these foreign hospitals expands options for complex medical conditions, it also underscores the existing gaps in Kenya's local healthcare infrastructure. The emphasis on a transparent, evidence-based system for referrals is a direct response to past criticisms and aims to restore public confidence in health financing. The Ministry of Health has further integrated an AI-driven fraud detection system with the TaifaCare platform to monitor transactions and prevent illicit payouts.

Recent developments have seen the Director of Public Prosecutions order charges against eight health facilities and several individuals over alleged fraud targeting the Social Health Authority, highlighting the ongoing battle against corruption within the sector. Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale recently clarified that claims of an KSh 11 billion loss were, in fact, rejected claims, not actual losses, as the Authority continues to strengthen its digital systems and oversight.

This commitment to robust, transparent systems is what Kenyans deserve in their public services, contrasting sharply with the challenges posed by power-hungry syndicates that too often undermine democratic institutions, as discussed in "Kenya Deserves Better: Power-Hungry Syndicates Passing Off as Political Parties Undermine Democracy". The SHA's efforts in providing a clear, regulated path for specialised medical care represent a positive stride in public service delivery and accountability.

Upon returning to Kenya, patients are mandated to report to a designated local facility for follow-up care, ensuring continuity and integration of treatment. This comprehensive approach reflects a concerted effort to provide not just access to critical medical interventions but also a structured continuum of care.
