## The "Unity" That Never Was: Kenzo's House of Cards
Wueh! If you thought 2025 was messy, February 2026 is already telling us "Hold my beer!" The so-called Ugandan Musicians Federation is currently bleeding, and the smell of the rot is reaching all the way to Entebbe. Our "President," Eddy Kenzo, tried to host a "Golden Gala" this past weekend to celebrate "industry growth," but let’s be real—the only thing growing is the audacity. 

Imagine! The tickets were priced like we’re paying off the national debt, only for the catering to look like a school visitation day snack pack. Kenzo spent the whole night dodging questions about the missing grant money while trying to look "international." Sasa basi, the "Big Talent" boss needs to realize that you can’t lead a federation on vibes and Grammys from five years ago. Character development is hitting him hard this week as the members demand to see the books. 

## Spice Diana’s Fashion Disaster and Fading Sparkle
And then we have the "Star Gal" herself. Spice Diana showed up looking like she got into a fight with a roll of aluminum foil and a glue gun. Kwani, does her stylist hate her? For someone who claims to be the queen of the new school, the performance was giving "low-energy karaoke." 

The tea is that Spice is fuming because she wasn't given the "Artist of the Decade" award at the gala. Sources say she nearly threw a glass at the organizers. Girl, maybe if you spent less time on TikTok and more time finding a song that actually sticks, you wouldn't be fighting for scraps. You’re being outshone by the drama, and that’s a bad look for a "queen."

## Jose Chameleone: The OG of Tantrums
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Ugandan mess without the Doctor himself, Jose Chameleone. The legend arrived late (as usual), demanded a microphone, and proceeded to insult everyone under forty. Chameleone is still acting like it’s 2005 and he’s the only lion in the jungle. 

He literally grabbed the mic from a rising artist and told the crowd that without him, there is no industry. The ego? Massive. The relevance? Sliding. He’s currently in a cold war with Kenzo because he thinks he should be the one running the Federation. Watching these two OGs fight over who gets to sit in the biggest plastic chair is the entertainment we didn’t know we needed.

## Bad Black: The Only Honest Person in Kampala
But let’s talk about the real MVP of the week: Bad Black. Mama Namuyimba decided to wake up and choose violence on Snapchat. She has been leaking voice notes all morning, alleging that the "Unity Gala" was just a front for certain artists to eat government money. 

Bad Black called out Kenzo for his "fake English" and dragged Spice Diana for her "cheap" outfits. She’s the only one with the balls to say that the federation is just a glorified chama for people who can’t sell out a concert anymore. She’s messy, she’s unfiltered, and honestly? She’s the only one telling the truth. 

The industry is in shambles, the "stars" are broke but sparkling, and the Tea Master is just getting started. Stay tuned, because if these voice notes are real, someone is going to be sleeping in Luzira by Friday!
