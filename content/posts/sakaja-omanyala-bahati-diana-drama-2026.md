## Nairobi is a Swimming Pool and Sakaja is the Lifeguard!
Wueh! Kanairo is currently one giant swimming pool, but does our Governor Johnson Sakaja care? Not at all! Instead of fixing the drainage that has turned CBD into a lagoon, Sakaja spent his week launching another "Nairobi Festival" with high-definition cameras and soft-lighting. Aki, this man loves PR more than he loves the people who voted for him. Imagine, citizens are wading through knee-deep water in South C, yet the Governor is busy on Instagram looking like a Pinterest model. Sasa basi, if we wanted a content creator, we would have voted for an influencer, not a politician! Sakaja, stop the "City of Order" hashtags and fix the pipes. This character development we are receiving from the rains is enough!

## Omanyala, Are You Running or Are You Modelling?
Then we have our brother, Ferdinand Omanyala. We love you, the continent’s fastest man, but lately, the only thing fast about Omanyala is how quickly he jumps into brand endorsements. This week’s performance at the Continental Tour was… let’s just say "humbling." While the Americans are hitting the gym, our boy is busy being a brand ambassador for everything from mattresses to toothpicks. Kwani, is the goal to win gold or to have the most billboards in Nairobi? Tea is, if Omanyala doesn't put down the camera and pick up the pace, even the pedestrians in Sakaja’s flooded streets will outrun him. Focus, mtu wangu!

## The Bahatis: The Script is Getting Old!
And of course, it wouldn't be a week in Kenya without the President and First Lady of Clout, Bahati and Diana Marua. These two need a new scriptwriter, honestly. This week’s "drama" involved Diana unfollowing Bahati and deleting photos—again. *Yawn.* We already know the drill: on Monday they "break up," on Wednesday Diana cries on YouTube, and by Friday, they drop a mediocre song together. 

Imagine, in 2026, people are still falling for this? Bahati, we know you’re trying to trend because your music career is on life support. Diana, we know the "breakup" is just to sell some Chinese skincare products. The desperation is stinking, and it’s louder than the noise in Sakaja’s nightclubs. If you two don't give us actual talent, just stay silent. The tea is cold, the clout is expired, and we are tired! Sasa basi, let’s see what new lie they’ll cook up by Sunday.
