## Forex Trader Sammyboy Sells IShowSpeed Signed Jersey

Kenyan forex trader Samuel Ondiek, known as Sammyboy, is currently auctioning an Off-White t-shirt signed by American streaming sensation IShowSpeed. The "basketball-style jersey" was reportedly signed during IShowSpeed's recent high-energy tour stop at the Mukuru Kwa Njenga affordable housing project in Nairobi. Sammyboy states the proceeds from this unique piece of memorabilia will be used to fund his trading account.

### The IShowSpeed Signed Jersey Hits the Market

Right, so you've heard of celebrities hawking their wares, but this is a bit different, isn't it? Our very own Kenyan "Forex Trader Sammyboy," whose real name is Samuel Mogaka Ondieki, has put an IShowSpeed signed jersey up for grabs on social media. Honestly, one might think he'd keep such a treasure in a display case forever, but no, apparently, he needs to "fund his trading account". Talk about turning fan adoration into, well, cold hard cash for the markets! [It’s a hustle, mate, you've got to admire the cheek of it!]

### Sammyboy's Plan to Fund Trading Account

The bidding process is live, running on a "highest bid wins" format, as Sammyboy himself confirmed. He met Darren Watkins Jr., or IShowSpeed, during the streamer's whirlwind visit to Kenya last month. The Off-White jersey, described as an XL, has been carefully preserved, with the signature intact and unwashed, to maintain its value. One has to wonder, with all the talk about funding, if this is a clever way to boost his capital after previous reports of significant trading losses. [Remember, he once admitted to losing a whopping KSh 18 million! That's a lot of shillings to make back, isn't it?]. Anyway, it certainly highlights the diverse ways people seek to finance their passions and ventures. It reminds one a bit of how different sectors struggle for recognition and resources, doesn't it? Speaking of which, have you seen the fuss about whether grassroots efforts are finally getting their due, like in the piece, [Get Out Get Active Shortlisted for Sport Industry Award: Is Grassroots Finally Getting Its Due, Mate?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/get-out-get-active-sport-industry-award-shortlist-pundit-view)? Different world, same underlying need for funds, eh?

### More IShowSpeed Headlines from His African Tour

Well, IShowSpeed certainly left his mark on the continent, didn't he? It wasn't just signed jerseys making headlines. The American streamer received an actual Ghanaian passport, with officials praising him for representing Africa globally. And who could forget the Nairobi haircut saga? A local barber, Joseph Cutz, claimed IShowSpeed paid a staggering KSh 2.5 million for a trim. Talk about a pricey haircut! [One could buy a small car for that, couldn't they?] Plus, our very own Mpasho even got a shout-out on Speed's Instagram carousel, celebrating his record-breaking livestream numbers in Kenya. Clearly, whether he's signing a jersey or getting a lavish haircut, IShowSpeed knows how to keep us all talking.
