## Political Control and the Kenya Infrastructure Fund

The proposed Kenya National Infrastructure Fund (NIF), intended to catalyse KSh 5 trillion in national development, faces a critical challenge: safeguarding its vast resources from political control. Dr. Benard William Chitunga, Chancellor of the Co-operative University of Kenya, has issued a stark warning that direct government oversight could lead to the fund's depletion through political interference. This concern echoes growing national debate on the NIF's governance structure.

President William Ruto's administration has championed the National Infrastructure Fund as a transformative initiative to mobilise KSh 5 trillion for critical projects, aiming to shift away from debt-heavy financing. The Cabinet has since approved the fund, which is envisioned as a limited liability company with a competitively appointed board and CEO to ensure strong governance and commercial discipline. The NIF Bill is currently before Parliament, seeking to establish this pivotal investment vehicle.

### Ensuring Prudent Management of the Kenya Infrastructure Fund

Dr. Chitunga, an International Civil Servant and Global Development Leader, whose expertise includes special funds management at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), argues that globally, sovereign and infrastructure funds are typically established as separate corporate entities. This structure, he explains, protects operations from excessive bureaucracy and short-term political pressure, fostering operational independence and enhanced governance. He asserts that by operating as private-like entities, these funds can attract professional talent, implement market-driven strategies, and mitigate risks associated with direct government control.

The government plans to capitalise the NIF by ring-fencing proceeds from the privatisation of mature state assets, such as the initial public offering (IPO) of Kenya Pipeline Company and a partial sale of its stake in Safaricom. This approach aims to leverage up to KSh 10 in private investment for every shilling committed to the fund, a significant multiplier intended to deepen financial markets and stimulate economic activity. However, this reliance on asset monetisation has drawn criticism from Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu, who questioned the sustainability of the strategy and the transparency of asset valuation processes.

### The Perils of Political Control on Public Funds

The debate surrounding the NIF's corporate structure highlights broader anxieties about transparency and accountability in public resource management. While a corporate model can shield the fund from daily political whims, critics fear it could also create an opaque environment where public scrutiny is limited, potentially mirroring controversial sovereign wealth setups in other developing nations where billions have reportedly vanished. Experts have noted that such a structure, while aiming for independence, could reroute operational reporting lines, drastically limiting public access to crucial audit trails and procurement methodologies.

Dr. Chitunga cites successful international models such as Singapore's Temasek Holdings and GIC Private Limited, as well as the UAE's Mubadala Investment Company and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which have effectively invested in infrastructure, energy, and technology across global markets under corporate structures. Temasek, for instance, has consistently achieved annualised returns of about 6 to 7 per cent over decades. Such examples underscore the potential for high financial returns when funds are managed professionally, free from undue political influence, much like how some companies, such as Carbacid, have seen significant gains through strategic investment. For a deeper understanding of how investment gains can bolster financial performance, one might consider reviewing analyses such as [Carbacid H1 2026 Earnings Lifted by Investment Gains: A Deep Dive into Performance](https://zandani.co.ke/article/carbacid-h1-2026-earnings-investment-gains).

Dr. Chitunga concludes that for the Kenya National Infrastructure Fund to succeed, it must adopt a corporate structure paired with merit-based appointments, a zero-tolerance stance on corruption, and robust transparency mechanisms. These measures are crucial to safeguarding the billions allocated to national development and ensuring the fund delivers on its ambitious promise without succumbing to the pitfalls of political control.
