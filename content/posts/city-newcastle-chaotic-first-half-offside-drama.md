Right, if you're just tuning into this City-Newcastle clash, you'll be scratching your head like I am. That disallowed equaliser from Burn? Utter robbery, mate! Honestly, when will they sort out this VAR business? It's just creating more arguments than it solves, isn't it?

## What's the Current Score Between Manchester City and Newcastle United?

At the Etihad Stadium, Manchester City leads Newcastle United 2-1 at the end of the first half. Youngster O’Reilly scored City's opener in the 14th minute and completed a brace in the 27th, while Hall equalised for Newcastle in the 22nd minute.

The first half at the Etihad was, to put it mildly, an absolute whirlwind. City, looking sharp from the off, saw young O'Reilly bag a brace, netting in the 14th and 27th minutes. But Newcastle, never one to roll over, pulled one back through Hall just eight minutes after City's opener. You'd think that would be the main talking point, wouldn't you? Oh no, not in this fixture. The sheer number of yellow cards dished out was something else entirely. Bernardo Silva, bless his heart, found himself in the referee's book, not for the first time this season, mind you. Apparently, he's never collected more yellow cards in a Premier League campaign for City. And Dias, who later got subbed for Khusanov at half-time, also saw yellow for a push on Gordon.

Look, Newcastle thought they had their equaliser when Burn rose highest from a Tonali free-kick and headed home, but the linesman, presumably with eyes like a hawk (or just lucky), flagged it for offside. The Magpies will be fuming about that one, as it genuinely looked a legitimate effort to my eye. It just goes to show, sometimes the best-laid plans, whether it's for a crucial equaliser or even something as ambitious as a Pan-African music strategy, just don't quite pan out as hoped. Remember when Samini unveiled his grand Pan-African Music Plan? [Link: Samini's Pan-African Music Plan: Is It Genius or Just Hype?](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/samini-pan-african-music-plan-genius-hype) Big ideas, but the execution can be a tricky beast. Newcastle’s Howe, making changes by bringing on Joelinton and Barnes for Woltemade and Willock, was clearly trying to shake things up, but City's Guardiola responded with Cherki for Marmoush. You could feel the tactical chess match unfolding.

So, the verdict? It's been an undeniably entertaining first half, full of goals, cards, and enough controversy to fuel pub debates for weeks. City are ahead, but Newcastle are far from out of this. With Tonali limping off (what is it with these knee injuries, eh?), and a mountain of bookings, the second half promises to be just as feisty. Hold onto your hats, because this one isn't over yet.
