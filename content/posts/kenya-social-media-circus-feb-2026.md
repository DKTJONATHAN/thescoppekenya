## Wueh! Kenya is a Movie!

Imagine! It’s only the first week of February 2026 and the scriptwriters of this country are already working overtime. If you thought 2025 was chaotic, sasa basi, welcome to the real circus. The main character this week? None other than the self-proclaimed President of Comedy, Eric Omondi. This man has transitioned from wearing cross-dressing costumes to wearing "activist" sackcloths, and honestly, the character development is giving me a headache.

Eric decided to stage a 48-hour hunger strike outside Parliament this week, claiming he won’t eat until the price of unga drops to 100 bob. Kwani? Does he think we have forgotten his previous "strikes" that ended with him eating KFC behind the scenes? The tea is piping hot because while Eric was busy crying on IG Live, the real owners of the country were busy showing us who the "shareholders" are.

## The Shareholder-in-Chief vs. The Activist

William Ruto and his Deputy, the one and only Rigathi Gachagua, have been moving around the country like they own the air we breathe. Riggy G is still stuck on his "shareholders" record—reminding everyone that if you didn’t vote for them, you’re basically a guest in your own country. Wueh! The arrogance! While people are struggling with the new taxes of 2026, our President William Ruto is on X (formerly Twitter) posting pictures of his expensive watches and "development" tours. The disconnect is wild! 

Sasa, instead of responding to the actual issues Eric Omondi was shouting about, the government's PR machine tried to trend a hashtag about "The New Kenya." We see you! We know the tea! You can’t hide the hunger with filters and high-definition cameras.

## Where is Baba and the OG?

And don’t even get me started on Raila Odinga. Baba has been uncharacteristically quiet this week, probably busy calculating his next move for 2027 or waiting for the perfect moment to release a riddle that no one understands. Raila’s silence is loud, and it’s making the streets nervous. Is he in a handshake or is he just tired of the drama? 

Then we have Khaligraph Jones. The OG himself. This week, the internet turned on him. People are asking, "Kwani Khaligraph forgot where he came from?" While Eric Omondi is at least trying (even if it’s for clout), the OG is busy posting videos of his new mansion and luxury cars. Netizens are dragging him for not using his voice to speak up against the current mess. Imagine! The man who used to rap about the struggle is now too rich to hear the noise from the ground. Khaligraph, even if the "Mazishi" is for your haters, don't forget the fans are the ones buying the data to watch you flex!

## The Verdict

This week has been a masterclass in clout chasing and political gaslighting. Between Eric Omondi’s theatrical hunger, William Ruto’s "Plan," Rigathi Gachagua’s "Shareholder" talk, and Khaligraph’s silence, the common mwananchi is just a spectator in a very expensive play. 

Character development is hitting everyone hard. Will Eric actually lose weight, or is this just another skit? Will Baba finally speak, or is he enjoying the peace? One thing is for sure: The tea in 2026 is bitter, and we are all forced to drink it. Stay tuned, because in Kenya, the plot twists never end!
