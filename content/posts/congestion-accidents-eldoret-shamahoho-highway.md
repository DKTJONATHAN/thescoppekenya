## Addressing Congestion and Accidents on Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway

Nandi Hills Member of Parliament Bernard Kitur has formally pressed the Ministry of Transport over the escalating number of road accidents and severe congestion plaguing the Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway. The lawmaker's intervention underscores urgent calls for the government to expedite expansion plans for this critical but overstretched corridor, which has become a major concern for commuters and stakeholders alike.

Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly on Wednesday, February 25, MP Kitur urged the Departmental Committee on Transport and Infrastructure to seek a comprehensive statement from the Ministry of Roads and Transport. His demand focuses on immediate safety measures and clear timelines for the long-awaited infrastructure upgrade, emphasizing that the road, designed decades ago, is no longer adequate for current traffic volumes.

### Escalating Concerns Over Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway Congestion

The Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway, a vital link between the North Rift and Western regions, is grappling with significant congestion that has worsened over time. MP Kitur highlighted that the narrow carriageway, originally designed in the late 1960s, cannot sustain the growing traffic, leading to frequent gridlocks and exposing motorists to heightened risks. This infrastructural inadequacy has been directly linked to a surge in fatal crashes, devastating families who rely on this busy route daily. The increasing traffic on such critical national arteries not only impedes movement but also has broader economic implications, much like the dynamic shifts observed in digital consumption, where platforms like Spotify recorded over 203 million hours of streams in Kenya in 2025, reshaping the national digital audio landscape.

Beyond the immediate danger, the MP argued that persistent congestion is stifling trade and slowing transport between Eldoret and Kisumu, two pivotal economic hubs that depend on efficient road connectivity. The delay in expanding this essential corridor poses a significant barrier to regional economic growth and seamless logistical operations.

### Fatal Accidents Persist on Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway Blackspots

The highway is notorious for several blackspots, particularly Mukhonje and Kaburengu in Lugari, Kakamega County, where serious accidents are reported almost weekly. In December 2025, a tragic collision involving a matatu and a truck at Mukhonje resulted in eight fatalities and seven injuries. Another incident near Kaburengu, where a matatu rammed into a stationary truck, further exemplifies the pattern of reckless overtaking, speeding, and dangerous interactions with heavy commercial vehicles that characterise this route. The persistent high accident rate on this corridor is a stark reminder of the broader national challenge in enhancing road safety, a concern also being addressed on other critical routes like the Mau Summit-Eldoret-Malaba section of the Northern Corridor, where a pre-feasibility study for expansion was launched in February 2026 to improve safety and ease congestion.

### Government's Response and Future of Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway Infrastructure

MP Kitur’s request now compels the parliamentary committee to seek detailed explanations from the Ministry regarding ongoing safety interventions and the planned expansion. Residents and traders require certainty on when the road will finally be upgraded to match contemporary transport demands.

The government has demonstrated some commitment to regional infrastructure development. On November 1, 2025, President William Ruto launched the Ksh1.57 billion 33-kilometre Shamakhokho-Kaimosi-Mpaka-Museno Road upgrade to bitumen standards in Vihiga and Kakamega counties. This project, implemented by the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA), is part of a broader infrastructure focus aimed at boosting trade and connecting key agricultural zones and institutions like Kaimosi University. The completion of the Shamakhokho-Kaimosi-Museno-Malinya road, also to bitumen standards, is projected for April 2028. This indicates a strategic effort to enhance road safety, improve connectivity, and stimulate economic growth across Western Kenya’s transport network.

National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula noted that the Departmental Committee on Transport and Infrastructure will hold a sitting on the matter and provide clear guidelines within one week, signaling parliamentary intent to address the alarming situation on the Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway with the urgency it demands.
