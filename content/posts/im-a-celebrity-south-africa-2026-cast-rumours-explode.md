Right, are you ready for this mess, then? Because ITV has only gone and confirmed that I'm A Celebrity South Africa is coming back this spring, and honestly, the rumour mill is absolutely churning with who's heading into the jungle! Ant and Dec even gave us a cheeky first look during *Britain's Got Talent* last Saturday, and bless Ant's heart, he nearly jumped out of his skin over a "big cat" sound! What a nightmare, honestly. Another little teaser is due next week, and apparently, Dec's going to be giving Ant a proper fright with all the creepy crawlies.

## Will Gemma Collins and Scarlett Moffatt Return to I'm A Celeb South Africa 2026?

Yes, speculation is rife regarding Gemma Collins and Scarlett Moffatt's potential return to I'm A Celebrity South Africa 2026, alongside numerous other celebrity names. Both television personalities have openly expressed their interest in rejoining the show, with Gemma famously having departed early in a previous series and Scarlett hoping to fully savour the experience with a more mature outlook.

## The Scoop

Well, mate, it's official! ITV has confirmed the return of *I'm A Celebrity South Africa* for 2026, and it's set to grace our screens this spring. We're talking about an all-star series, apparently, with familiar faces battling it out for the ultimate champion title. The first glimpse, a brief ten-second clip during *Britain's Got Talent*, showed our beloved hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly looking rather cosy around a campfire. Then, poor Ant heard a noise, and Dec, being Dec, claimed it was a "big cat," sending Ant absolutely leaping up! Can you even imagine? Honestly, those two. Another snippet is promised for next week's *Britain's Got Talent*, where a weary Ant bids Dec "goodnight," only for Dec to start rattling off a list of everything that bites, ticks, or crawls in South Africa, leaving Ant looking utterly shaken.

## The Evidence

Now, for the juicy bits! The rumour mill is absolutely buzzing with names, and some of them are truly iconic. Gemma Collins, the GC herself, has reportedly signed up once more. Remember when she famously quit the Australian camp after just 72 hours? She did say back in 2015 that "Everything would be different a second time. I'd be like Lara Croft and Angelina Jolie rolled into one, and I'd do the tasks". We shall see, eh? Then there's Scarlett Moffatt, who told *OK! Magazine* she'd "just soak up every second again" if she returned, feeling she knows herself better now. Bless her!

Other names being thrown around like confetti at a wedding include boxer David Haye, Olympic legend Sir Mo Farah, actor Craig Charles, comedian Seann Walsh, *Emmerdale's* Adam Thomas, singer Sinitta, Pussycat Dolls star Ashley Roberts, ex-footballer Jimmy Bullard, and *Coronation Street's* Beverley Callard. Apparently, even Harry Redknapp is on the list, and he won it before, didn't he? While ITV does say any names are "just speculation", it seems *The Mirror* has gone ahead and reported a "full list" of who's in. It's also been hinted that this series will be "tougher than ever", with a live final from the UK where the public will decide the winner! Honestly, these African Entertainment Stars: Are They Secretly Filthy Rich?

## The Verdict

Honestly, mate, what a lineup! If even half these names are true, we're in for an absolute treat of drama and laughs, aren't we? Will Gemma actually conquer those tasks, or will we see another early departure? And will Scarlett finally get to enjoy every single second without a worry in the world? It's going to be fascinating to watch these legends, some of whom have already won, try to become the ultimate all-star champion. I mean, who wouldn't want to see Sir Mo Farah facing a Bushtucker Trial again, eh? Get the kettle on, because this spring is going to be wild!
