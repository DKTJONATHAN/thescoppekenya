Sasa, makofi! The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase we've all been huko waiting for finally hit yesterday, February 5th, 2026, and let me tell you, ilikuwa moto kama pasi! For thirty minutes straight, third-party developers dropped some serious heat, especially for the Nintendo Switch 2 crew.

First off, Bethesda alikam na kiburi, akituletea titles tatu kubwa kwa Switch 2. Get ready for *Indiana Jones and the Great Circle*, *Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition* (coming February 24, 2026), na *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered*, zote zikija kwa Switch 2! Hiyo ni kucheza na hisia zetu kabisa!

Then, the whispers about *Hollow Knight* getting a glow-up for Switch 2 were true! It dropped yesterday, February 5th, and existing owners get a free upgrade. Si mchezo! Also, for all you *Final Fantasy* die-hards, *Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth* is making its way to Switch 2 on June 3, 2026. Cheki sasa!

The Resident Evil gang also made a grand entrance. *Resident Evil Requiem* is set to terrorize Switch 2 on February 27, 2026, alongside *Resident Evil Biohazard Gold Edition* na *Resident Evil Village*. Na kama hiyo haitoshi, there's a *Resident Evil Requiem* themed Switch 2 Pro Controller and even Amiibo figures for Grace and Leon coming! Hiyo ni kama kusema, "hatukuacha peke yenu."

Lakini si hizo tu! Walitupa kibao cha games zingine, including *Orbitals*, *Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse*, *Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters*, *Tokyo Scramble*, *Valheim*, na *eFootball Kick-Off!*. Plus, *Super Bomberman Collection* na *Console Archives* (ikiwa na *Cool Boarders* na *Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos*) zilitupwa kama shadow drops! Yani, you could play them right after the showcase!

Kusema ukweli, the showcase was packed, though some bangers like *The Duskbloods* and *Professor Layton and The New World of Steam* missed the party. Still, Nintendo na mabeshte zake wametuletea mzigo wa kutosha kukaa busy. Enjoy the grind, wajanja!
