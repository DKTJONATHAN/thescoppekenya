## KAA Unveils Ambitious 20-Year Masterplan for JKIA Terminal Modernisation

The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has presented a comprehensive 20-Year Masterplan (2025-2045) for Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) Terminal Modernisation, designed to elevate the facility to a world-class aviation hub. This strategic blueprint aims to increase JKIA's annual passenger handling capacity from 7.5 million to an eventual 27 million, addressing current congestion and enhancing operational efficiency.

### Driving Capacity and Efficiency Through JKIA Terminal Modernisation

The unveiled 20-Year Masterplan outlines a transformative agenda for Kenya's primary aviation gateway. Presented to staff during a consultative forum on Wednesday, February 26, the plan seeks to expand JKIA's annual passenger handling capacity significantly. KAA Managing Director Mohamud Gedi highlighted that the modernisation effort would first raise the existing terminal's capacity from 7.5 million to 12 million passengers annually. This initial enhancement is intended to alleviate congestion and improve the overall passenger experience. Notably, JKIA has been operating beyond its original design capacity, handling 8.6 million passengers in 2024 and 8.8 million in 2025, exceeding its current limit of 8 million. Projections indicate that existing facilities would reach operational breaking points within three years without intervention.

### The 20-Year Masterplan: Phased Implementation and Funding Strategy

Central to the KAA Masterplan is the construction of a brand-new terminal complex, designed to ultimately accommodate an additional 15 million passengers per year. This ambitious project will be executed in two distinct phases. Phase I is slated to deliver a terminal capable of handling 10 million passengers annually, with a subsequent Phase II adding a further 5 million. Beyond terminal upgrades, the masterplan also proposes the construction of a much-needed second runway by 2029, a critical addition expected to increase aircraft movements from the current 14 per hour to approximately 63 per hour.

The financing of these extensive projects will be spearheaded by President William Ruto's administration, marking a state-led approach to infrastructure delivery. This strategy follows the government's decision in late 2024 to terminate a previous KSh 238 billion renovation agreement with the Adani Group, opting instead for public ownership and partnerships with development finance institutions. Such significant government commitments to national infrastructure projects often draw considerable public interest and scrutiny, echoing past discussions surrounding the management and disposition of strategic national assets. For instance, the High Court's stance on the Kenya Pipeline sale underscored the complexities inherent in public-private ventures and asset management.

### Economic Projections and Regional Hub Aspirations in the KAA Masterplan

KAA Managing Director Mohamud Gedi underscored the broader economic impact anticipated from the JKIA Terminal Modernisation. The projects are expected to significantly enhance Kenya's position as a regional aviation hub, boosting air connectivity, supporting tourism and trade, and stimulating broader economic growth in line with the country’s Vision 2030 development agenda. This modernisation is deemed critical for maintaining JKIA's competitiveness, especially with neighbouring countries like Ethiopia and Rwanda actively developing their own substantial aviation infrastructure. The plan includes optimized airside infrastructure designed to handle over 860,000 tonnes of cargo annually, a key advantage for Kenya's fresh produce exporters.

### Stakeholder Engagement and the Future of KAA Operations

Beyond the physical infrastructure upgrades, the KAA Masterplan forum also addressed critical issues concerning airport workers' welfare, operational efficiency, and organisational effectiveness. The KAA managing director emphasised the importance of service excellence as JKIA prepares for increased passenger traffic over the next two decades. The consultative session allowed employees to raise day-to-day operational concerns, demonstrating a shared commitment to continuous improvement. KAA has also confirmed ongoing engagements with the Kenya Aviation Workers Union (KAWU), with further consultations involving other key stakeholders scheduled as preparations continue for the airport's anticipated development and transformation. The involvement of global expertise, notably Dar Al-Handasah, in developing this 20-Year Masterplan further solidifies its strategic alignment with international best practices.
