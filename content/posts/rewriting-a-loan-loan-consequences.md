## Rewriting a Loan: Regulatory Scrutiny and Penalties

Rewriting a loan involves altering its terms, which can have significant financial consequences for both lenders and borrowers. Misleading representations and unconscionable conduct in such processes, as seen in a recent credit renewal dispute involving Guaranty Trust Bank Kenya Limited, can lead to substantial regulatory penalties. The Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) has demonstrated a firm stance against such practices, signaling increased scrutiny in the financial sector.

### The Consequences of Rewriting a Loan: A Case Study

Guaranty Trust Bank Kenya Ltd (GT Bank) has been fined KSh33.18 million by the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) for improper conduct in a credit renewal dispute with manufacturer ASL Limited. The regulator accused the bank of misleading representations and unconscionable conduct, specifically citing the retroactive application of default interest and the presentation of materially altered loan terms as routine renewals. The penalty, set at 2% of the bank’s gross turnover, underscores the CAK's commitment to scrutinising how lenders manage expiring facilities and borrower leverage. In addition to the fine, GT Bank was ordered to refund ASL KSh13.21 million, representing improperly levied fees and charges. GT Bank has appealed this decision before the Competition Tribunal, maintaining that its actions complied with contractual obligations and banking regulations. The case highlights the critical importance of transparency and fair dealing when rewriting a loan or renewing credit facilities.

### Broader Economic Consequences and Market Dynamics

Beyond individual disputes, the broader economic landscape presents various challenges and opportunities for Kenyan businesses. Transporters in Kenya are grappling with a surge in highway theft, which places both cargo and drivers at considerable risk. Current tax regulations mandate that duties are paid even on stolen shipments, effectively turning victims into debtors. The Kenya Transporters Association (KTA) advocates for increased freight rates, convoy systems, secure parking, and comprehensive insurance to mitigate these escalating hazards. These recommendations reflect a broader industry plea for operational survival in a sector where risk often outpaces reward.

Kenya's trade access also faces potential volatility, as underscored by a recent US Supreme Court ruling concerning emergency powers used to impose tariffs. For Kenya, whose apparel exports largely rely on preferential access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), this situation highlights a deeper vulnerability: trade access granted at Washington's discretion can shift abruptly. The ruling clarifies the imperative for Kenya to diversify its market access, reducing its reliance on the evolving legal and political landscape of American trade policy. Kenya's economic resilience, however, is not solely dependent on external trade agreements. Initiatives aimed at strengthening domestic sectors, such as the [Kenya Shifts to Soil-Health-Centered Agricultural Transformation: A New Era for Farmers](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenya-shifts-to-soil-health-centered-agricultural-transformation), underscore a proactive approach to sustainable growth and reduced reliance on volatile global markets.

### Mitigating Loan Consequences: Industry Calls for Clarity

The banking sector, while facing regulatory pressure over loan rewriting, is also seeing innovation. Grey, a pan-African fintech company, has launched 'Grey Business,' a multi-currency payments platform designed to simplify international transactions for startups and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) across Africa. This platform enables businesses to manage global payments with enhanced speed and transparency. Grey Business, officially launched on February 10, 2026, at the Africa Tech Summit in Nairobi, facilitates opening USD corporate accounts, sending and receiving global payments, and instant currency conversion at real-time exchange rates.

Meanwhile, CIC Insurance Group has issued a profit warning for FY 2025, anticipating a profit decline of at least 25% due to rising claims and the absence of a one-off land revaluation gain recorded in 2024. As of Friday, February 27, 2026, CIC Insurance Group Limited (CIC) closed at KES 5.36 per share on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). The company's stock has gained 17.3% year-to-date, ranking it 27th on the NSE in terms of performance.

In the electric mobility sector, Spiro, a pan-African company, secured US$50 million in debt financing from Afreximbank, Nithio, and the Africa Go Green Fund to expand its battery-swapping network. This funding, announced in late February 2026, supports the expansion of Spiro's battery-swapping infrastructure across existing and new markets, as well as advancing its proprietary technology.

Looking ahead, Kenya is preparing to host the 4th Kenya International Investment Conference (KIICO) 2026 at the Radisson Blu Upper Hill from March 25-27, 2026. Invest Kenya CEO John Mwendwa aims to secure $2 billion in investment commitments during the conference. KIICO 2026 will also feature the 2nd COMESA Investment Forum on March 26 and the Africa Green Industrialization Initiative (AGII) on March 27. John Mwendwa was appointed CEO of the Kenya Investment Authority (Invest Kenya) in January 2025. These events are crucial for attracting foreign direct investment and fostering economic growth, providing a platform for strategic dialogues and deal-making.
