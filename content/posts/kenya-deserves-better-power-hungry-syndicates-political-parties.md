## Kenya Deserves Better Than Power-Hungry Syndicates

The purpose of political parties in Kenya should be to interpret the general will of the people and ensure delegated sovereign power adheres to the Constitution. Instead, many operate as power-hungry syndicates, reducing democracy to a brutal contest for dominance rather than a mechanism for collective aspiration.

### The Constitutional Mandate Versus Power-Hungry Syndicates

Kenya's 2010 Constitution unequivocally vests all sovereign power in the people, to be exercised strictly in accordance with its provisions. This power is delegated, not seized, a fundamental distinction often lost in our political discourse. When political parties speak of "capturing power," they evoke notions of coups or usurpation, bypassing the indivisible will of the people. This rhetoric, openly espoused by figures such as ODM leader Oburu Oginga, who currently serves as Acting Party Leader, reduces our vibrant democracy to a zero-sum game for dominance. Such a mindset is not merely pragmatic cynicism; it is a direct assault on the constitutional foundations that underpin our nation.

The Political Parties Act (2011) was enacted to provide an institutional, legal, and regulatory framework for parties, explicitly envisaging entities that respect internal democracy and their constitutional status. However, the reality on the ground paints a starkly different picture. Many of Kenya's 91 fully registered political parties brazenly flout their own constitutions by neglecting internal elections, a clear sign of undemocratic tendencies that foreshadow how they would wield sovereign power. The Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) noted in its 2024-2025 Annual Report that over 60 parties underwent training on dispute resolution during this period, implying systemic weaknesses in leadership renewal. This indicates a pervasive lack of internal democracy, a systemic failure also highlighted by the Katiba Institute, which observes that parties frequently prioritise tribal mobilisation over constitutional adherence.

### The Cost of Power-Hungry Syndicates on Public Trust

The consequences of this "capture power" mantra are profound and detrimental to our democratic health. In Kenya's patronage-driven political landscape, it fosters elite pacts that alienate citizens, perpetuating cycles of corruption, ethnic division, and institutional decay. While parties like UDA and ODM claim millions of members, these figures often represent a fraction of the population, underscoring how these entities frequently serve as niche vehicles for personal ambition rather than broad interpreters of the general will.

The integrity of our electoral processes, the very mechanism through which the people delegate their power, is compromised. The 2025 by-elections, for instance, were marred by violence, voter bribery, and overt political interference, according to reports by the Elections Observation Group (ELOG) and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR). These reports detailed instances of clashes between rival supporters, allegations of monetary inducements, and even deaths, painting a grim picture of how power-centric politics devolves into chaos. How can we trust parties to uphold the national social contract when they cannot even democratically elect their own leaders or ensure peaceful electoral contests? This hypocrisy erodes public trust and discourages active civic participation.

### Reorienting Political Parties Towards the General Will

Kenya deserves better. We must reorient our political parties towards their ideal role: as stewards discerning the general will through genuine public participation. This entails persuading voters of their worthiness for delegation, rooted in the constitutional values enshrined in Article 10, such as accountability, equity, and inclusion.

Political parties, as guardians of the public interest, should interpret collective aspirations on critical issues like corruption, burgeoning national debt, persistent unemployment, and executive overreach. They should be the mechanisms through which citizens hold their leaders accountable, translating the promises of the Constitution into tangible improvements in daily life. Consider the persistent challenges faced by commuters and residents along the Eldoret-Shamahoho Highway, where [congestion and accidents have led to rising fatalities, prompting urgent calls for action from elected representatives](https://zandani.co.ke/article/congestion-accidents-eldoret-shamahoho-highway). This is precisely the kind of issue that parties, if truly focused on the general will, should champion, offering clear, actionable solutions rather than engaging in endless power struggles.

This vision honours the transformative spirit of our Constitution, shifting politics from a battlefield of dominance to a bridge for the expression of the general will. By embracing parties as authentic interpreters of the people's will, we safeguard our sovereignty and build a truly democratic future. The time to challenge the "capture power" narrative is now, before it irrevocably usurps our shared destiny. The true purpose of political parties is to persuade the people to delegate sovereign power to them through a demonstration of constitutional fidelity and a commitment to collective well-being.
