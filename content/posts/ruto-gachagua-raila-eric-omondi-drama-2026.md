Wueh! The week has barely started and the tea is already boiling over the sufuria. If you thought 2025 was a movie, 2026 is a whole Netflix series with bad directors and actors who forgot their scripts. Kenya is not a real country, I swear!

## The Grand Delusion at State House
William Ruto spent the whole weekend telling us how the "hustlers" are finally winning. Which hustlers? The ones living in State House? Because on the ground, things are thick! Imagine! The man is out here launching the same road for the fifth time while we are surviving on air and prayers. It’s giving "delusional" and his PR team is working overtime to polish a brick. Sasa basi, instead of fixing the economy, he’s busy flying to another country to give a speech about "Africa’s potential" while our potential is being swallowed by KRA. Kwani, are we a joke to you?

## Gachagua and the "Shareholder" Tears
Then we have the Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua. Honestly, the character development this man is putting his supporters through is elite. He spent his week fighting imaginary enemies in Mt. Kenya and shouting about "shareholders." Someone tell him the company is bankrupt! While the youth are jobless and the tea prices are a joke, Riggy G is busy settling scores. The rift between him and the boss is so wide you could fit a whole SGR train inside. The marriage is hitting the rocks, and we are just here for the debris.

## Eric Omondi vs. The System
The real MVP this week? Eric Omondi. Say what you want about his clout-chasing, but at least he has more spine than half of the Parliament combined. He took the drama to the Parliament gates again, and of course, the police did what they do best—harass the truth. He was arrested for trying to hand over a petition about the unga prices that have refused to come down. Imagine being arrested for saying you’re hungry! It’s a circus, and Eric is the only one pointing out the clowns.

## The OG Drops the Lyrical Truth
Even the OG, Khaligraph Jones, couldn't stay silent anymore. When the cost of living hits the rappers, you know the country is in the ICU. He dropped a freestyle this week that has the State House shaking. When Khaligraph stops talking about "Mazishi" and starts talking about "Njaa," the government should be very afraid. His bars were harder than the life we are living, and honestly, it’s the anthem we needed. The OG has spoken, and the politicians are catching feelings instead of fixing the mess.

## Baba is Playing 4D Chess
And where is Agwambo? Raila Odinga is just sitting there sipping his tea, watching the house burn. Is he the savior? Probably not. Is he waiting for a handshake? Most likely. The silence from the opposition is louder than Ruto’s helicopters. Raila is playing 4D chess while the rest of us are playing kalulu. We are stuck between a government that doesn't care and an opposition that is "monitoring the situation." 

Wueh! It’s messy, it’s loud, and the tea is exceptionally bitter this morning. Stay tuned, because in this country, the plot twists never end!
