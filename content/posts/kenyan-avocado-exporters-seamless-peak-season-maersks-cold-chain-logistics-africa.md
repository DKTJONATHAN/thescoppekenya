## Ensuring a Seamless Peak Season for Kenyan Avocado Exporters

Kenya's avocado industry is bracing for a robust 2026 peak season, with global logistics giant Maersk implementing strategic initiatives to guarantee that **Kenyan avocado exporters** achieve a **seamless peak season**. These measures, announced on February 23, 2026, aim to fortify the cold chain and enhance market access for the country's high-quality avocados. Maersk's commitment underscores the vital role of efficient logistics in Kenya's agricultural export economy.

The global demand for avocados continues its upward trend, driven by health and culinary versatility, positioning Kenya as a key player in international markets. The nation is projected to produce approximately 445,650 metric tons of avocados by 2026, marking a 3.5% annual growth since 2021, with total output potentially increasing by 20% compared to the previous year.

### Maersk's Enhanced Cold Chain Logistics Africa Support

**Maersk's Cold Chain Logistics Africa** strategy involves a multi-faceted approach to support avocado growers and exporters. On-site technical training sessions are being conducted at packhouses across Kenya, focusing on critical areas such as reefer container handling and cold chain process management. These hands-on programs provide exporters with the necessary technical knowledge to maintain optimal temperature conditions throughout the supply chain, a crucial factor for perishable goods.

Complementing the practical training, Maersk is offering online courses covering customs processes, required documentation, and process timelines. These digital sessions also provide updated information on current routing options and transit times, enabling informed shipping decisions for **Kenyan avocado exporters**. Such operational excellence and capacity enhancement are critical to meet the anticipated surge in demand during the peak season.

### Market Outlook and Regulatory Landscape for Kenyan Avocado Exporters

The 2026 Hass avocado season is anticipated to be a landmark year, characterized by high value despite climatic and regulatory challenges. The sea export window, strategically closed in October 2025 to prevent the export of immature fruit, is officially scheduled to reopen in mid-March 2026. Air exports remain an option for specific varieties like Hass and Fuerte, provided strict traceability measures are met.

Export prices for the 2026 season are trending upwards, influenced by lower yields in competing markets globally. Farmers can expect farm-gate prices for export-grade produce to range from KES 150 to KES 180 per kilogram for premium sizes. While Hass avocados remain a global favorite, green-skin varieties like Fuerte are gaining momentum, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey.

The Horticultural Crops Directorate (HCD) and the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) have tightened regulations for 2026 to safeguard Kenya's global reputation. This includes a "Farm-to-Port" tracking system and stringent phytosanitary certificate requirements, ensuring avocados are free from pests.

### The Broader Impact of Cold Chain Logistics Africa

Maersk's initiatives are not just about transportation; they represent a comprehensive support system that empowers **Kenyan avocado exporters** to meet growing international demand. Tito Okuku, Managing Director of Maersk East Africa, emphasized the company's commitment to being present, prepared, and proactive, ensuring every shipment receives due attention.

Beyond specific crop logistics, the efficiency of national infrastructure plays a foundational role in the overall export capability of the country. Discussions surrounding national infrastructure, such as past high court rulings on entities like the Kenya Pipeline, highlight the continuous need for strategic investments that support broad economic activity and, by extension, agricultural export ambitions. While the focus here is on **Maersk's Cold Chain Logistics Africa**, the interconnectedness of transport, energy, and regulatory frameworks is undeniable for sustained growth.

As Kenya continues to solidify its position as a leading supplier of high-quality avocados, reliable and innovative logistics partnerships will be crucial in ensuring a **seamless peak season** and long-term success for its agricultural sector.
