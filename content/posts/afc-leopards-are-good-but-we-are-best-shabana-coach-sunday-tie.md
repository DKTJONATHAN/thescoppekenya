## "AFC Leopards are good but we are best" - Shabana Coach Unleashes Pre-Match Firepower

Shabana FC head coach Peter Okidi has boldly stated, "AFC Leopards are a good team, but we are the best," setting the stage for an explosive encounter ahead of their crucial Sunday tie in the FKF Premier League. This declaration comes as both teams are locked on 40 points, vying fiercely for top honours in the league standings.

The highly anticipated Sunday tie pits two of the league's titans against each other, with AFC Leopards currently sitting second and Shabana FC in a formidable third position. Shabana's coach, Peter Okidi, has not shied away from stoking the flames, declaring a "revenge mission" for points previously lost to Leopards. This kind of spirited verbal exchange, while common in sports, can sometimes escalate, much like when a Siaya County Officer faced suspension over alleged defamatory remarks against Governor Orengo, highlighting the fine line between passionate expression and contentious statements.

### Shabana Coach's Confidence Soars After Recent Victory

Shabana FC approaches this pivotal "Sunday tie" with immense momentum, fresh off a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Mathare United on Wednesday, February 25, 2026. The decisive goal, a last-gasp equalizer by George Orako, showcased Shabana's resilience and determination, further fueling the coach's confident assertion. Okidi underlined his team's hunger, stating, "It is also a game where the team that will have the hunger for goals will carry the day, and we believe that we have the hunger and energy to do so". This unwavering belief from the "Shabana coach" is a clear signal of their intent to secure maximum points.

### AFC Leopards Face Pressure After Setback Ahead of the Sunday Tie

Conversely, AFC Leopards enters this crucial clash under a cloud of recent disappointment. Ingwe suffered a significant blow to their title aspirations, falling 1-0 to KCB on Thursday, February 26, 2026. This defeat has intensified the pressure on Fred Ambani's charges to bounce back strongly, especially with Gor Mahia maintaining a six-point lead at the top of the table. The "Sunday tie" is not just another fixture; it is a battle for redemption and a crucial step in the title chase for both sides. With the "Shabana coach" openly challenging their supremacy, the atmosphere promises to be nothing short of electrifying. Football fans across Kenya are undoubtedly bracing themselves for a spectacle of skill, passion, and tactical brilliance this coming Sunday.
