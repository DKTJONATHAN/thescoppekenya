## KeNHA Allays Fears of Flooding at Nairobi Greenpark Underpass

The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has definitively dismissed widely circulated images purporting to show severe flooding at the Greenpark Pedestrian Underpass in Nairobi. The Authority confirmed on Thursday, February 26, 2026, that these viral images were artificially generated using Artificial Intelligence and do not represent the actual condition of the recently constructed facility. This clarification aims to counter public concern regarding the underpass's structural integrity and drainage capabilities.

### The Genesis of the Flooding at Nairobi Greenpark Underpass Claims

The deceptive images, which gained significant traction across various social media platforms earlier this week, depicted the Greenpark Pedestrian Underpass partially submerged in rainwater. This immediately prompted widespread public discourse and concern among Kenyans, with many questioning the quality of construction and the efficacy of the drainage systems at the crucial Haile Selassie-Uhuru Highway roundabout facility. Such rapid dissemination of unverified digital content underscores the challenges of information veracity in contemporary society, a topic often explored in discussions around public figures and their influence, as seen in analyses like [Pashkiran Reddy's Influential South Africa Voice in 2026: More Than Just a Celebrity Chef?](https://zandani.co.ke/article/pashkiran-reddy-influential-south-africa-2026-celebrity-chef-gossip).

### Ensuring No Flooding at Nairobi Greenpark Underpass: Engineering Integrity

KeNHA has provided extensive assurances regarding the underpass's engineering design, explicitly stating that it is fitted with a robust drainage system. This system is engineered to channel any infiltrating water to a dedicated collection chamber, from which it is efficiently pumped out, thereby preventing any accumulation or flooding. Furthermore, the Authority highlighted that all entry points to the underpass are strategically elevated, preventing external surface water from entering the structure to an extent that could cause flooding. These design considerations are critical for a facility expected to accommodate over 21,000 pedestrians daily, easing congestion at one of Nairobi's busiest intersections.

### KeNHA Allays Fears: A Call for Verification in the Digital Age

In its official statement, KeNHA reiterated that the AI-generated image was designed to mislead and create unnecessary public anxiety. The Authority urged the public to exercise caution and verify any information shared on social media platforms through KeNHA's official communication channels before further circulation. These official channels include their Facebook page (Kenya National Highways Authority), X account (@KeNHAKenya), Instagram (@Kenha_kenya), TikTok (@Kenhaofficial), and designated contact numbers. This proactive stance by KeNHA emphasizes the national importance of accurate information dissemination, particularly concerning critical public infrastructure projects.

### Anticipating the Greenpark Underpass Opening

The Greenpark Pedestrian Underpass, a significant Ksh2 billion project funded through the Road Maintenance Levy Fund, is a key component of the government's broader strategy to enhance urban transport infrastructure and pedestrian safety in the capital. KeNHA recently indicated that the underpass project is approximately 97 to 99 percent complete. The Authority anticipates the official opening of the underpass for public use in June 2026. This state-of-the-art facility will feature modern amenities such as CCTV cameras, seven elevators for persons with disabilities, adequate lighting, public washrooms, and vendor stalls, alongside a dedicated aeration system for user comfort and round-the-clock security monitoring.
