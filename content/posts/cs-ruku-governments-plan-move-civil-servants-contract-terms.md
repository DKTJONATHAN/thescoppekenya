## CS Ruku Unveils Government's Plan for Civil Servants

Public Service Cabinet Secretary Geoffrey Ruku announced a significant policy shift on Thursday, February 26, 2026, outlining the Government's plan to transition all civil servants from permanent and pensionable employment to contract-based terms. This proposal, part of a new Public Service Transformation Policy, aims to address long-standing issues within the public sector, including impunity and absenteeism.

### The Genesis of Contract Terms for Civil Servants

The announcement by CS Ruku was made during the launch of the Public Service Commission (PSC) Strategic Plan 2025-2029. He revealed that the proposal will be presented to a Cabinet committee in the coming week, followed by submission to the full Cabinet in March 2026 for consideration. The core of this proposed framework involves engaging public servants on renewable contracts lasting three or five years, with renewal contingent on meeting specific performance targets. Those who fulfill their contractual obligations will see their terms renewed, while those who do not will be required to exit the service.

### Addressing Impunity and Improving Service Delivery

CS Ruku articulated that the fundamental objective of moving civil servants to contract terms is to foster a results-driven culture within the public service. He cited concerns about what he described as impunity, entitlement, and persistent absenteeism among some long-serving public officers. The Cabinet Secretary underscored that while interns consistently report to work punctually, many of their supervisors often do not, highlighting a perceived breakdown in discipline. This reform initiative, if implemented, is projected to affect over one million public workers, marking a substantial departure from the traditional employment model in Kenya. The government posits that this will enhance discipline and lead to improved service delivery across various government institutions.

### Public and Stakeholder Reactions to the Government's Plan

The pronouncement by CS Ruku has already generated considerable discussion and mixed reactions across the nation. While proponents of performance contracting argue that it could bolster accountability and efficiency, critics express concerns regarding potential implications for job security and the independence of various institutions. The transition represents a profound overhaul of Kenya's public service labour market and is anticipated to precipitate extensive debate, particularly from labour unions. As the government moves towards presenting this policy to the Cabinet, the discourse surrounding its constitutional and labour law implications is expected to intensify.
