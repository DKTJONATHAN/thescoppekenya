Middle-distance sensation Emmanuel Wanyonyi also kicked off his season with a fourth-place finish at the Sirikwa Classic Cross Country on February 14, 2026. Wanyonyi has stated his intention to focus on training and skip the indoor calendar, with plans to compete in the Commonwealth Games and the Diamond League circuit later in the year.

### Faith Kipyegon's Endorsements and Road Race Debut
Faith Kipyegon, the undisputed queen of the track, is making headlines off and on the field. She has secured a significant endorsement deal, partnering with a leading Kenyan maize mill company, a testament to her expanding influence. Kipyegon also showcased her versatility by winning her debut 10km road race in Monaco on February 15, 2026, a remarkable feat in her transition to road running. Fans can look forward to seeing her back in action as she is scheduled to race the 3000m at the Monaco Diamond League in July 2026.

### Kipchoge's Olympic Recognition

## Top Stories: Reflecting on 2025 Triumphs and Future Prospects

Looking back at 2025, Kenyan athletes delivered numerous **top stories** and unforgettable performances that continue to resonate. These past achievements lay the groundwork for current aspirations and future successes.

### Marathon Dominance: Obiri's New York Triumph and London Challenge
Hellen Obiri cemented her status as a marathon force with a sensational victory at the 2025 New York City Marathon on Sunday, November 2. Obiri not only won her second title in the city but also obliterated the course record, finishing ahead of fellow Kenyans Sharon Lokedi and Sheila Chepkirui. Her parents and daughter were there to warmly receive her at the finishing line, a truly heartwarming moment. Obiri achieved this remarkable feat while wearing the ON Cloudboom Strike LS shoes, the same pair she donned during her Boston 2024 win. Navigating such a major international event, especially one in the "Big Apple," can sometimes present its own set of challenges, reminding us of past travel disruptions experienced by Kenyan travelers heading to the US, as highlighted in the story [Kenya Airways' Big Apple Blizzard Blunder!](https://zandani.co.ke/article/kenya-airways-newyork-snowstorm-drama).

As we move further into 2026, Obiri is set to make her highly anticipated London Marathon debut on April 26, where she will face a formidable field of the world's fastest women. This promises another thrilling chapter in her illustrious career.

However, the 2025 season also brought some surprising decisions, with Beatrice Chebet and Faith Kipyegon notably missing out on the Women’s Track Athlete of the Year final shortlist, a shocking development given their brilliant performances throughout the year. Despite this past snub, Beatrice Chebet has announced she will be taking a break from competition throughout 2026 as she is pregnant, a joyous personal development for the world record holder.
