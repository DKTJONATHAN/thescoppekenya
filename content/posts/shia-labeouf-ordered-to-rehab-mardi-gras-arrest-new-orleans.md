## Shia LaBeouf Ordered to Rehab Following Mardi Gras Arrest in New Orleans

Actor Shia LaBeouf has been mandated to attend substance abuse treatment and undergo drug tests following his February 17 arrest in New Orleans during the city's lively Mardi Gras celebrations. This decision came after a court hearing on February 26, where a judge imposed new conditions for his release.

The "Transformers" star found himself embroiled in fresh legal woes after an alleged altercation at Royal Street Inn & R Bar, leading to his arrest on two counts of misdemeanor battery. Police reports indicate that officers were called around midnight after LaBeouf was reportedly thrown out of the bar for causing a disturbance with aggressive behavior. He allegedly struck one man multiple times with closed fists and punched another in the nose. Onlookers reportedly held LaBeouf down until authorities arrived, after which he was taken to a hospital before being arrested.

### Judge Mandates Treatment After New Orleans Incident

Orleans Parish Criminal Court Judge Simone Levine was firm in her ruling on Thursday, February 26, mandating that LaBeouf enroll in treatment for substance abuse, undergo drug testing, and post a significant bond of $100,000 for his release. This move came after it was revealed that allegations of LaBeouf using homophobic slurs were not part of the official court record when he was initially released on his own recognizance. Judge Levine expressed concerns about LaBeouf's behavior and his seriousness regarding his alcohol addiction.

### LaBeouf's Mardi Gras Arrest and Legal History

LaBeouf's arrest during the festive Mardi Gras period has certainly set tongues wagging across the entertainment world. This incident adds to a long list of celebrity legal woes, reminding us that even the biggest stars face scrutiny, much like the intense public interest surrounding [African Culture & Entertainment: The REAL Drama Behind 2025's Big Moments!](https://zandani.co.ke/article/african-culture-entertainment-drama-2025-moments). His attorney, Sarah Chervinsky, a former public defender, is now representing him in this case. Chervinsky was notably part of the legal team for Cardell Hayes, who was convicted in the death of New Orleans Saints star Will Smith.

The "Even Stevens" alum is no stranger to legal challenges, with past arrests and a sexual battery lawsuit filed by his former girlfriend FKA Twigs in 2020, which was settled out of court in July. Despite his lawyer stating that a recent drug test did not show illegal substances in his system, Judge Levine remained concerned about his approach to his alcohol addiction. LaBeouf has agreed to the updated terms of his release, which also include staying away from the alleged victims and the bar where the altercation occurred. The actor has yet to enter a formal plea to the charges.
