## The Marriage is Peeling Like a Bad Sunburn!
Sasa basi, let’s talk about the elephant in the room—or should I say, the two elephants who are tired of sharing the same grass. This week has been a masterclass in "Character Development." President William Ruto and his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua are giving us the fakest smiles in African history. Kwani who are they fooling? One minute they are at a church service in Nyeri pretending to be besties, the next minute Gachagua’s people are shouting about "Mount Kenya betrayal." Wueh! The tea is boiling, and the pot is about to crack. If you think your toxic ex was bad, look at the Presidency. It’s giving "we are together for the kids (voters) but I sleep on the sofa."

## Baba is in Addis but the Spirit is in Kisumu
Meanwhile, Raila Odinga is busy playing the "Statesman" at the AUC, but let’s be real—the man can’t help himself. Every time he tweets a cryptic "..." we all start wondering if another handshake is cooking. Imagine! At his age, he still has the entire government checking their blood pressure every time he lands at JKIA. Is he retiring? Is he coming back? Raila is like that legendary series that refuses to have a series finale. We are tired of the suspense, Baba! Tell us if you're in the race or if you're just enjoying the Ethiopian coffee.

## Eric Omondi is the Real "Opposition"
While the "official" opposition is busy in boardroom meetings, Eric Omondi is on the streets doing the heavy lifting. Kwani what is happening? This week Eric has been exposing more scandals than the Auditor General. He’s out here showing us how hospitals have no medicine while MPs are debating about their car allowances. The way Eric is moving, he’s making the likes of Kalonzo look like they are on a permanent vacation. He’s loud, he’s messy, and honestly? He’s the only one making these politicians sweat. Sasa basi, will he actually run in 2027 or is this just one long comedy skit? Because the joke is currently on the taxpayer!

## Khaligraph Jones Needs to Drop a New Diss Track
And where is the OG? Khaligraph Jones dropped a few lines this week that had some politicians catching feelings. When the OG speaks, you know the ground is not level. He’s calling out the "mapambano" lies and the rising cost of living that even the "Hustlers" can’t afford. It’s funny how a rapper has more balls to speak the truth than half of the Senate. If the music doesn't wake you up, then your pockets must be very heavy with "public funds."

## The Verdict: A Nation of Clowns led by Magicians
Look, 2026 is starting to feel like a very long year. Ruto is busy launching the same project for the fifth time, Gachagua is busy protecting a "limbo" that’s already shifting, and the common mwananchi is just a spectator in this circus. The tea is bitter, the snacks are finished, and the performers are tired. If this is the "Plan," then someone definitely lost the manual. Stay tuned, because in this country, the only thing that works reliably is the drama! 

Wueh! What a week!
