Wasee, mambo ni matatu! The internet is still buzzing after Billie Eilish dropped some truth bombs at the recent Grammys, and now Mark Ruffalo has jumped into the ring to defend her, telling Kevin O'Leary to "STFU" in a savage online clapback.

Apparently, Ms. Eilish, while accepting her Song of the Year award for "Wildflower" at the 2026 Grammys, didn't hold back. She declared, "no one is illegal on stolen land," and even threw in a "F-k ICE," which was censored during the broadcast, but everyone heard it! Talk about kutoa mdomo!

Now, *Shark Tank*'s Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful himself, wasn't feeling the vibe. He went on Fox News and, kama kawaida, gave his two cents, advising celebrities to "shut your mouth, and just entertain." Ai, kwani ni yeye ndio boss?

But Mark Ruffalo, our very own Hulk, wasn't having any of that. He took to Threads on Thursday, February 5, 2026, and unleashed a whole vibe, telling O'Leary, "Kevin O'Leary why don't you STFU." Ruffalo did not stop there, calling out O'Leary's "fantasy double standard," saying he expects people to listen to his "s-t" but can't handle an artist speaking up. He even threw in a jab about O'Leary's role in "Marty Supreme," saying he "played yourself well." Bure kabisa!

It's not just Ruffalo pekee; Billie's brother and producer, Finneas O'Connell, also weighed in on Threads, calling out "powerful old white men" who were "outraged" by his 24-year-old sister's speech. The heat is real!

Meanwhile, critics are also poking holes in Billie's stance, with some pointing out that her own Los Angeles mansion sits on indigenous Tongva tribal land. Some even suggested she should return the property or host migrants there.

The whole drama has got the streets talking, sparking a major debate about whether celebrities should use their platforms for political talk or just stick to entertaining. Yaani, the conversation is still cooking like a fresh mandazi as of today, February 7, 2026. This beef clearly ain't over, my people!
