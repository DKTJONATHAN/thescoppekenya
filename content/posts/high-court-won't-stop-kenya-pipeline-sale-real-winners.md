## High Court Declines to Stop Kenya Pipeline Company Sale: The Gossip Columnist's Take!

The High Court of Kenya recently dismissed consolidated petitions aiming to halt the proposed privatization of the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), effectively clearing the path for the government to proceed with the sale. Judges found the process largely compliant with constitutional and legal requirements for public asset disposal. This decision paves the way for the government to offload a 65% stake in the profitable state-owned firm.

Honestly, mate, everyone's still buzzing about the High Court declining to stop the sale of the Kenya Pipeline Company! (What a kerfuffle, eh?) You'd think with all the ruckus, someone would have managed to put a spanner in the works. But no, the judges have given it the green light, saying the whole privatisation process has been above board, following all the tricky constitutional bits and bobs. Can you even imagine the sighs of relief from certain government bigwigs? And the groans from those who desperately wanted to stop it! It's all rather dramatic, isn't it?

### The Whispers: Who *Really* Benefits from This Kenya Pipeline Company Sale?

Right, so the official line is that selling off 65% of the Kenya Pipeline Company will bring in a whopping KSh 106 billion! That money, they say, is earmarked for fancy new roads, energy projects, and all sorts of development, saving us from more taxes or borrowing. Sounds grand, doesn't it? But honestly, a little bird told me some folks are whispering about who the *real* beneficiaries might be. Is it genuinely for the everyday citizen, or are there some well-connected individuals just waiting to snap up a piece of this very profitable pie? (What a thought!) Critics were up in arms, claiming the whole thing lacked transparency and that KPC might be undervalued. But the court just wasn't persuaded, darling. It makes you wonder, doesn't it? Who’s getting rich here, beyond the public coffers?

### The Drama of the High Court Declining to Stop the Sale: Petitions, Politics, and Power Plays

Well, there have been petitions flying around like confetti at a wedding, all trying to get the High Court to stop the Kenya Pipeline Company sale. Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah, bless his cotton socks, was right there, trying to halt what he called an "imminent and unconstitutional privatisation process." He even raised concerns about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and their alleged influence. Talk about gripping courtroom drama! But on February 19, the High Court dismissed those consolidated petitions, stating the process met all the constitutional and legal thresholds. Then, on February 23, another judge, Lawrence Mugambi, declined to issue conservatory (temporary) orders in Omtatah’s petition, saying it was a bit premature for such big decisions. It’s almost like a thrilling soap opera, isn't it?
