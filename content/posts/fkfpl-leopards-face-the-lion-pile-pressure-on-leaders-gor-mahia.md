## FKFPL: Leopards Face The Lion in Crucial Showdown

The FKF Premier League delivers another thrilling round of matches today, Thursday, February 26, as teams battle for supremacy and survival. Kenyan giants AFC Leopards are set to clash with KCB FC, a pivotal encounter where "Ingwe" aims to pile pressure on current league leaders Gor Mahia.

### AFC Leopards on the Hunt to Pile Pressure on Leaders Gor Mahia

AFC Leopards, known affectionately as "Ingwe" by their fervent supporters, are poised for a significant challenge against KCB FC. The 1998 league champions will be looking to narrow the gap between themselves and league leaders Gor Mahia to just three points with a victory today. Gor Mahia currently sits at the summit of the league table with 46 points, while AFC Leopards are second with 40 points, level with Shabana but ahead on goal difference.

AFC Leopards boasts impressive form, having suffered only one defeat in their last ten matches, including five wins in their previous six fixtures. Their latest triumph was a 2-1 victory over Posta Rangers. The Fred Ambani-coached side is acutely aware of Shabana's pressure, as both teams are tied on points in the race for second place. AFC Leopards, a club founded in 1964 as Abaluhya United Football Club, later changing its name to Abaluhya Football Club in 1973 before becoming AFC Leopards in 1980, remains one of Kenya's most storied teams.

### KCB FC, "The Lion," Seeks Redemption Against Leopards

KCB FC, often referred to as "The Lion," enters this fixture in 10th position with 29 points, having endured a relatively challenging season. They will be keen to bounce back from two losses in their last five matches, including a recent 3-0 defeat to Gor Mahia. Leading KCB is former AFC Leopards head coach Robert Matano, who is determined to guide his team to a much-needed win. Assistant coach Paul Ogai has emphasized the need for strategic adjustments, particularly in their attacking third and defensive solidity, to counter the strong AFC Leopards side.

The encounter between AFC Leopards and KCB FC is scheduled for 1615 hrs at the iconic Nyayo National Stadium, promising to be the highlight of today's FKFPL action.

### Other Key FKFPL Encounters Across the Nation

Beyond the Leopards versus The Lion clash, the FKF Premier League serves up a full plate of exciting matches. Defending champions Police FC, currently seventh with 31 points and on a poor run of form with only one win in their last eleven league matches, will face bottom-placed Sofapaka at the Vapor Grounds, Ngong, kicking off at 1300 hrs. Sofapaka is in a dire situation, sitting at the bottom with 14 points and a thirteen-match winless streak, including ten losses.

Meanwhile, military side Ulinzi Stars, struggling in 16th place with 18 points and a six-match winless run, will host Mozzart Bet-sponsored Kakamega Homeboyz at the Ulinzi Sports Complex from 1400 hrs. Homeboyz are fourth on the log with 34 points and have won three of their last four matches.

In another crucial fixture for teams entrenched in the relegation battle, APS Bomet, backed by Mozzart Bet Kenya, will welcome 2018 Mozzart Bet Cup champions Kariobangi Sharks at the Awendo Green Stadium from 1400 hrs. Both teams are tied on 19 points, with APS Bomet just one place above Kariobangi Sharks in 14th. APS head coach Sammy Pamzo Omollo has declared this a "must-win" game for their survival hopes.

Lastly, Bidco United will lock horns with Mara Sugar at the Wang'uru Stadium from 1500 hrs. Bidco United, currently in the relegation zone with 16 points and a sixteen-match winless run, desperately seeks a victory to boost their survival chances. Twelfth-placed Mara Sugar will be aiming to widen the gap between themselves and the lower pack.

Today's matches are set to significantly reshape both ends of the FKFPL table. As we witness these intense battles, it's a reminder of the enduring spirit and passion that defines football, a passion that resonates globally, much like the historic moments seen in the [Women's World Cup 2023: Spain's Historic Triumph and the Global Game's Irresistible Rise](https://zandani.co.ke/article/women-s-world-cup-2023).
