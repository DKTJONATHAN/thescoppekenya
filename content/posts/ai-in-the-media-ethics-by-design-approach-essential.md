## AI in the media: The Imperative of an Ethics-by-Design Approach

The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence into Kenyan media enterprises is transforming workflows, from content creation to audience analysis, promising unprecedented efficiency and data-driven insights. This technological revolution, however, casts a long shadow, bringing to the fore profound ethical questions that demand an **ethics-by-design approach** rather than an afterthought. The core challenge lies in ensuring that innovation serves the public good without compromising the foundational principles of journalism.

### Cultivating AI Fluency and an Ethics-by-Design Approach

The conversation surrounding **AI in the media** frequently gravitates towards its technical prowess, but the more critical discourse must centre on the ethical implications. Kenyan media houses are already deploying AI across various stages of their operations, including story pitching, news gathering, content production, dissemination, and fact-checking. This widespread adoption necessitates that journalists and media practitioners cultivate a robust "AI fluency" - a skill set that transcends mere operational knowledge to encompass the responsible conceptualisation, design, training, and deployment of these systems. It is not enough to simply use the tools; we must understand their inherent biases and potential for harm.

The Media Council of Kenya (MCK) has taken a commendable step forward with its Code of Conduct for Media Practice, 2025, which explicitly addresses the ethical thresholds for AI use. Part Four (Section 27) of this code provides a clear checklist that media houses must satisfy before deploying AI technology, emphasising human oversight as the guiding principle. This affirms the "human-in-the-loop" concept, ensuring that accountability ultimately rests with individuals, not algorithms. Similarly, the MCK's Media Guide on the Use of Artificial Intelligence offers a practical manual, drawing guidance from international bodies like UNESCO and the Paris Charter on AI and Journalism, which champion ethical principles for news and information integrity.

### The Perils Without an Ethics-by-Design Approach in Content

The risks associated with unbridled AI integration are substantial. Algorithmic bias, hallucination, disinformation, and misinformation pose direct threats to accuracy and erode public trust - the very currency of credible journalism. Without an **ethics-by-design approach**, media organisations risk becoming conduits for manipulated content. Consider the implications if an AI tool for audience analysis prioritises cost-efficiency over transparency, fairness, inclusivity, and audience privacy, or fails to interrogate the biases embedded in its training data. This is not merely a hypothetical concern; UNESCO has warned that creators worldwide face significant income losses due to AI, highlighting the broader societal and economic impacts that must be considered within an ethical framework.

The media's role is to act in the public interest. Is the use of AI genuinely for the public good, or is it merely a strategic decision driven by the allure of emerging technologies? This is a question that demands introspection. The public has a right to know when AI has been used to modify images, videos, or editorial content, a principle of active disclosure enshrined in ethical guidelines. Transparency is not an option; it is a fundamental requirement for maintaining credibility. Just as we demand accountability from public servants for the resources they manage - a topic I have explored previously regarding the inherent challenges in our administrative structures, as seen in the discussion around [Devolution Was Never Meant to Be a Feeding Trough: A Crisis of Credibility](https://zandani.co.ke/article/devolution-never-meant-to-be-feeding-trough-credibility-crisis) - so too must we demand transparency and accountability from media entities deploying powerful AI tools.

### The Future of AI in the media: Beyond Efficiency

As AI continues its inexorable march towards Artificial General Intelligence and Artificial Super Intelligence, the need for consistent AI fluency among journalists will only intensify. Media enterprises and their development partners must invest proactively in equipping journalists with these essential skills. This includes understanding prompt literacy, verification literacy, and the editorial confidence to discern when to accept or reject AI-generated suggestions, ensuring human judgment remains paramount.

The goal should not be to automate journalism entirely, but to augment human capabilities responsibly. The transformation of newsrooms necessitates new roles like "Prompt Engineer" and "AI Ethicist," reflecting a growing recognition that ethical governance and bias mitigation must be embedded within newsroom structures. The future of **AI in the media** hinges on a collective commitment to an **ethics-by-design approach**, one that prioritises human agency, accountability, and the unwavering pursuit of truth. Anything less risks a future where media becomes a purveyor of polished but potentially prejudiced narratives, ultimately undermining the very foundation of an informed citizenry.
