## Get Out Get Active: Shortlisted for a Silver Anniversary Gong!

Get Out Get Active (GOGA), a UK-wide programme led by Activity Alliance, has officially made the coveted shortlist for the 25th Sport Industry Awards, an event celebrating excellence across the sector. This nomination positions them among the finest in the industry, with the awards ceremony set to gather over 1,500 senior executives on April 30th, 2026, to honour outstanding achievements in sport.

### A Right Good Shout for Inclusivity

Right, you’ve got to hand it to them, haven’t you? When you hear "Sport Industry Awards," your mind often jumps straight to the big-money deals, the massive sponsorship activations, or perhaps some eye-watering tech innovation. But here we have Get Out Get Active, a programme that's all about bringing disabled and non-disabled people together through physical activity, bagging a shortlist spot. That's proper brilliant, mate. It’s a UK-wide initiative, mind, getting people off the sofa and into everything from paddleboarding to superhero workouts. We're talking about over 58,000 participants to date, with a staggering 81% reporting improvements in their mental wellbeing. Absolute madness, the impact they're having!

### The Power of Sport Beyond the Pitch

This isn't just about handing out shiny trophies, is it? The Sport Industry Awards, now in their 25th year, recognise everything from world-class events to rightsholders using sport to drive social change. And that's where GOGA truly shines. They're not just about participation; they're about strengthening community spirit, boosting confidence, and improving mental health across the board. It’s a stark reminder that sport, at its heart, is a powerful tool for good. Speaking of sport driving change, we've seen similar buzz about nations trying to awaken their sporting potential, haven't we? Remember all that chatter about [India Football Reforms: Is the 'Sleeping Giant' Finally Stirring, Mate?](https://zandani.co.ke/posts/india-football-reforms-sleeping-giant-stirring)? It just goes to show, doesn't it, mate? Sport isn't just about the top leagues; it's about igniting that passion everywhere, from the local park to a whole blooming nation!

### What's Next for GOGA?

So, will Get Out Get Active walk away with a gong on April 30th? Who knows, eh? But honestly, just making the shortlist for an event attended by over 1,500 senior executives is a massive win in itself. It puts their incredible work in front of the very people who can help scale it even further. It's a testament to the fact that genuine impact and inclusivity are finally getting the recognition they deserve in the big leagues of the sports industry. Let's hope this nomination sparks even more investment and interest in grassroots, inclusive programmes. Because, let’s be honest, that’s where the real magic happens, isn't it?
