## Mohamed Salah Exit: Liverpool's Stance Crystal Clear (Or Is It, Mate?)

Right, so the rumour mill is absolutely churning, isn't it? Reports are flying around that Mohamed Salah is "increasingly likely" to be packing his bags from Liverpool come the summer transfer window. The Reds' hierarchy, it seems, are making their position crystal clear: they won't want their Egyptian King to trot off on a free transfer next year. This all comes despite Salah signing a new two-year deal with the club in April 2025, keeping him at Anfield until the summer of 2027. So, while a free transfer isn't imminent, selling this summer (2026) would certainly prevent that scenario next year.

### The December Dust-Up and Slot's Shaky Season

It’s been a bit of absolute madness at Anfield this season, hasn't it? The source text highlights an alleged "outburst" from Salah back in December, where he reportedly accused Liverpool of scapegoating him and claimed to have no relationship with manager Arne Slot. That's a strong claim, mate, and it led to him apparently being dropped for a Champions League match before a swift reintegration. You've got to wonder what actually went down behind those dressing room doors, eh? Adding to the drama, Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has weighed in, suggesting Salah "hasn't been anywhere near" his best this season. It's fair to say Slot's position has been under some serious review this season, with results and performances causing some concern, even after guiding Liverpool to the Premier League crown in his debut season.

### Saudi, MLS, and a Saudi Shake-Up

The whispers about Salah heading to Saudi Arabia or the MLS have been doing the rounds for ages, haven't they? Fabrizio Romano, the transfer guru himself, apparently gave an update "earlier this month" (February 2026), stating that Saudi clubs, potentially Al-Ittihad, would be back in the conversation this summer. Now, this is where it gets interesting, because some of the details in the original report about Al-Ittihad's situation are a bit... backwards, if you ask me.

While Al-Ittihad were indeed looking for big names, it's actually **Karim Benzema** who left them for rivals Al Hilal in early February 2026, and **N'Golo Kante** terminated his contract to join Fenerbahce around the same time. So, Al-Ittihad *did* lose superstars. But the twist? Youssef En-Nesyri, who Romano reportedly mentioned "for Fenerbahce," actually made the move *from* Fenerbahce to Al-Ittihad on February 3, 2026, to fill that attacking void! Talk about a mix-up, eh? So, if Salah *does* fancy a move to the Saudi Pro League, Al-Ittihad certainly have a need for another marquee signing to be the face of their league, especially after all that player movement. It's a huge market, and clubs are always on the lookout for a new star to boost their global appeal, much like how tech giants keep pushing the boundaries with new innovations, as seen with the recent Galaxy UNPACKED 2026 event.

### The Olise Option: A Bayern Bargaining Battle?

Of course, if Salah does depart, Liverpool will need a replacement, won't they? And the name being bandied about is Michael Olise. Reports suggest Liverpool are "desperate" to bring the winger to Anfield from Bayern Munich. Olise, who moved to Bayern in July 2024, has been in superb form in the Bundesliga. However, mate, this won't be an easy snatch. Bayern Munich reportedly have "no intention of selling" Olise this summer, and he's tied down on a long-term contract until 2029. There are even whispers that his contract doesn't include a release clause, which would make any potential transfer fee absolutely eye-watering - potentially "over £100m". So, while Olise might be a dream target, prising him away from the German giants could be a monumental task.

It's all set up for a fascinating summer, isn't it? Will Salah stay and see out his contract, or will the lure of a new challenge, and Liverpool's desire to cash in, see him off to pastures new? Only time will tell, but it's certainly got everyone talking!
