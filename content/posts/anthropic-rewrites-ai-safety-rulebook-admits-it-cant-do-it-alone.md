## Anthropic Rewrites AI Safety Rulebook for a Collaborative Future

Anthropic has released version 3.0 of its Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), a revised framework guiding its AI development with a clearer distinction between the company's internal commitments and its recommendations for the wider AI industry. This update, published on February 24, 2026, acknowledges that no single entity can unilaterally address the catastrophic risks associated with advanced artificial intelligence.

### The Evolution of Anthropic's AI Safety Rulebook

The third iteration of Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy reflects over two and a half years of practical experience with its initial framework. The original 2023 policy featured a straightforward trigger system, activating stricter safety protocols when models approached dangerous capabilities, such as assisting in the creation of biological weapons. However, Anthropic encountered a "zone of ambiguity" where models neared these thresholds without definitively crossing them, complicating the implementation of stronger measures.

A significant shift in this updated **AI Safety Rulebook** is Anthropic's candid admission that solving catastrophic AI risks requires a collective industry effort. The company has recognized that unilateral action, while impactful, is insufficient in the face of rapidly advancing AI capabilities and a policy environment that has, at times, prioritized competitiveness over caution. This recalibration emphasizes a shared responsibility across the AI ecosystem.

### Enhanced Transparency and Risk Reporting

The revised RSP introduces two key mechanisms aimed at bolstering transparency and accountability. Firstly, Anthropic will publish a public list of safety goals, known as its Frontier Safety Roadmap, encompassing critical areas like security, model behavior, and government policy. The company has committed to openly reporting on its progress against these goals.

Secondly, the policy mandates the publication of detailed risk assessments every three to six months. These reports will elaborate on each model's capabilities, the potential dangers they might pose, and the safeguards implemented. Crucially, some of these risk assessments will be subject to review by independent outside reviewers. The importance of such external scrutiny resonates across various sectors, underscoring the universal need for impartial evaluation when public safety is concerned, much like the ongoing scrutiny over bridge safety.

### Competitive Pressures and the "Admits It Can't Do It Alone" Stance

The update to Anthropic's **AI Safety Rulebook** comes amidst an increasingly competitive landscape. Recent reports indicate that Anthropic has adjusted its stance on unconditionally halting AI development if safety measures are deemed inadequate. The revised policy now suggests that development delays will occur "until and unless we no longer believe we have a significant lead" over competitors. This shift reflects the company's navigation of market pressures and the perceived risk that responsible developers might fall behind if others advance without strong mitigations.

This dynamic is further highlighted by recent events, including the launch of Claude Code Security on February 20, 2026. This reasoning-based vulnerability scanner from Anthropic reportedly led to a notable drop in cybersecurity stock values, signaling its disruptive potential in the industry. Furthermore, Anthropic has recently faced a public disagreement with the Pentagon regarding the military use of its AI, with reports of the Pentagon threatening to blacklist the company. This dispute appears to center on Anthropic's usage policy rather than its scaling policy.

While Anthropic **Admits It Can't Do It Alone**, its earlier policy did inspire comparable safety efforts from industry giants like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Google DeepMind, for instance, has also updated its Frontier Safety Framework, now in its third version, focusing on "Harmful Manipulation Key Capability Levels" and "control challenges". Meanwhile, OpenAI's internal safety structures continue to evolve, with the dissolution of its Mission Alignment unit in February 2026 raising questions about the future of centralized AI safety teams within the organization. The collective movement towards more formalized safety frameworks, even with varying approaches, signals a maturing understanding of AI's societal impact.
